While Shringla is personally engaging with individual Congressman, other diplomats from the mission are traveling to key US states to work with Congressmen in their constituencies, ET has learnt.The Embassy has also made efforts to provide information on developments in Jammu & Kashmir on a real-time basis to Congressmen and their staffers. A delegation of Congressional staffers may visit India shortly to get an understanding of the Kashmir situation, ET has learnt.A comprehensive strategy for a focused and coordinated outreach to Congress has been planned by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Embassy. Foreign minister S Jaishankar is expected to visit Washington DC in near future and a 2+2 (Foreign-Defence Minister) Dialogue is being planned on that occasion.The Embassy is planning to hold at least two joint events over the next few weeks with key Congressmen in their constituencies to meet Indian community representatives there. Diplomats from the Indian Embassy in Washington and consulates have been deployed to work the corridors of Congress and engage with congressional staffers to appraise them about the situation in Kashmir and threats from across the border.The ambassador has himself engaged with more than 100 Congressmen besides briefing the House Foreign Relations Committee on the decision to scrap Article 370 and the situation in Kashmir. Similar briefings in the US Senate for both senators and their staffers are also being planned.The Embassy is also working with friends of India, including Jewish groups, business lobbies and professional associations in securing better access to key US Congressmen and engaging them.

1,1-11-2019,Motown queens fail to live up to top safety standards in tests,"NEW DELHI: India’s top-selling hatchbacks, Maruti Suzuki WagonR and Hyundai Santro, received two stars and the Datsun RediGo got a single star in crash tests conducted by UK-based private vehicle safety group Global NCAP.The Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, the local market leader’s multi-purpose vehicle, scored three stars in the tests.Five stars denote the best safety rating for a vehicle, according to Global NCAP.The group said it chose entry-level versions of the Ertiga, WagonR, Santro and the RediGo in the sixth round of its #SaferCarsForIndia crash tests. Of these, the Ertiga was fitted with two airbags as standard, while the other models offered only a driver-side frontal airbag. The results highlight significant differences in adult occupant protection in cars that meet the latest government-mandated vehicle technical regulations in India, the group said.Global NCAP chief executive David Ward said the tests showed a mixed safety performance. “The Ertiga achieves a creditable three stars for both adult and child occupant protection, but it's obvious that more can and should be done to improve overall protection levels for cars sold in the market,” he said.  “The Indian government's crash test standards are clearly helping to eliminate any new zero-star cars from the market,” he added.The WagonR and Santro achieved two stars for adult and child occupant protection, Global NCAP said. These models offer only one airbag as standard. Their structures, however, were rated as unstable. The RediGo achieved one star for adult occupant protection and two stars for child protection. It also offers only one airbag as standard and its structure was also rated as unstable.As for the Ertiga, Global NCAP said it achieved three stars for both adult occupant and child occupant protection. The model offers two frontal airbags as standard. Its structure was rated as “borderline unstable”, which the agency said could be improved."," India's top-selling hatchbacks and multi-purpose vehicles received two or one stars in crash tests conducted by UK-based private vehicle safety group Global NCAP.

2,1-11-2019,Lupin looks to sell Japanese arm Kyowa for $600 million,"MUMBAI: India’s Lupin Ltd is in advanced talks to sell its Japanese generics subsidiary Kyowa Pharmaceuticals for an enterprise value of $600 million to a local player as it steps up efforts to significantly cut operations in the world’s third largest pharma market. The name of the buyer could not be independently verified. People close to the discussions said that an announcement is expected in November.In August, Lupin sold its injectables business to neo ALA Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi based Neopharma group, for an undisclosed sum to help streamline Japanese operations and increase focus on branded generics.Lupin did not respond to emails till press time on Thursday.Lupin acquired Kyowa in 2007 from the Sugiura family, two years after entering a strategic alliance to market finished formulations in Japan. In 2018-19, Kyowa earned revenue of Rs 1,784 crore, contributing 11% to Lupin’s consolidated revenues. It grew a modest 5% over the year-ago level. Its net profit halved to Rs 68.6 crore – constituting 11.3% of Lupin’s consolidated profit while Ebitda margins also dropped sharply from 20% to 11%.  Lupin is among the few Indian players that managed to crack the highly-regulated, brand-conscious $100-billion East Asian market.It has been reviewing its global footprint and the decision to scale down Japan is part of that exercise, officials aware of the development said. “The Japanese subsidiary grew at an impressive 14%+ CAGR in the last 11 years (since acquisition) in yen terms,” said an official familiar with the ongoing developments on condition of anonymity as talks are in private domain. “However, the recent decline in growth and impending further decline have led to re-evaluate the market and investment. Pricing pressure in Japan has hit the company very hard, especially last year. Since then, gross margins have dropped from 55% in FY18 to 31% in FY19.” At a recent analysts call, Lupin managing director Nilesh Gupta said, “Volume growth will happen, but value growth will be muted as far as Japan is concerned. We need to bring cost efficiencies and operational excellence into the structure.”Lupin has already moved a lion’s share of its drugs for Japan to its Goa manufacturing plant and wants to vertically integrate it. Its latest annual report says that the Japanese generics market is increasingly converging towards a substitution-oriented model and it needs to develop products at the right cost, gain substantial market share and simultaneously build the specialty portfolio.Surajit Pal, senior analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, said such a move would be good for Lupin and its investors. Despite its growth potential, the slow-growing Japanese business has been a drag on profitability, he added."," Mumbai-based drugmaker Lupin Ltd is in advanced talks to sell its Japanese generics subsidiary Kyowa Pharmaceuticals for an enterprise value of $600 million to a local player as it steps up efforts to significantly cut operations in the world's third largest pharma market.

4,1-11-2019,"With no liquidity, liquor sales on the rocks","You know the glass is half-empty when a major company selling liquid stimulants holds back on pushing sales because the trade is hit by a liquidity shortage.United Spirits Limited, India’s biggest liquor firm which sells brands including Johnnie Walker and McDowell’s, told investors during an earnings call last week that in order to “minimise credit risk” in a liquor trade facing a “big time liquidity crunch”, it’s no longer doing aggressive sales.Basically, the liquor company fears traders will stock the products but won’t be able to pay, adding to its bad debts. “This time the reality is, there are real liquidity issues in the marketplace with the trading community. So, if you supply, they will take the stock, but it’s at your peril,” Anand Kripalu, managing director at USL, told investors.“It is not as if we are not supplying at all. We are just being cautious about the last push,” Kripalu said. “Some of the competitors in the marketplace decided to increase credit in high-risk market. We decided we won’t do that.”Poor Growth“This remains part of our philosophy to not keep having provisions of bad debt, because you sell and then you just find it hard to collect,” he said.Liquor trade’s hangover from the economic slowdown is similar to FMCG failing to take a bigger bite out of consumer spend, again thanks to liquidity issues. Hindustan Unilever, the country’s largest packaged consumer goods firm, had last month said trade was facing an acute liquidity crunch.Diageo-controlled USL reported volume growth of just 1% year on year in the quarter ended September, mainly because of a slowdown in consumer demand along with liquidity challenges. The company had posted 10.3% volume growth a year ago.Similar to FMCG, the overall liquor market in the country recorded 2-3% growth in the nine months to September, which companies attribute to floods in some states and an increase in taxes, on top of a broad economic slump that has taken a toll on consumption. Adding to the impact on numbers is the high base of 2018, when the market grew 10% to a six-year high.Sales volume of locally made foreign liquor increased 1.4% year on year in the September quarter. Whiskey and brandy showed poor growth, vodka and gin segments declined, industry executives said, citing excise department data. A year ago, the market had grown 12.9% in the same quarter.Diageo's biggest rival, Pernod Ricard, too, saw its Indian business growth slowing to 3% in the September quarter from 34% in the year-earlier period.Analysts expect liquor sales to remain subdued for the rest of the fiscal. “We expect demand to remain subdued Q2FY20 onwards,” said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president of institutional equities at Edelweiss Research. “Spirits, being more discretionary in nature, are expected to face volume deceleration in ensuing quarters. While the volume decline may not be as severe as in the four-wheeler and two-wheeler segments, we nevertheless expect softness in demand for the liquor sector,” he said."," The article reports that United Spirits Limited, India's biggest liquor firm which sells brands including Johnnie Walker and McDowell's, has held back on aggressive sales because of a liquidity shortage in the liquor trade.

As you head for the day’s trade, here is a compilation of overnight analyst calls on various stocks.• Jefferies has upgraded Gujarat Gas to buy from hold and raised target price to Rs 240 from Rs 170 following the stock's recent underperformance versus peers. Despite weaker FO cracks, the loss of market share to FO is not playing out amidst regulatory support and uncertainty on longer term FO prices thereby mitigating key concern on Gujarat Gas, said Jefferies.

Shares of Gujarat Gas ended down 0.1 per cent at Rs 195.50 on Thursday.• HSBC has cut target price on SKF India to Rs 2,450 from Rs 2,500 on the back of near term earnings cuts. HSBC has retained buy recommendation. The second quarter saw sharp fall in automotive segment and deteriorating mix, cushioned by exports and industrial segment. The industrial segment shows potential and the automotive segment still offers room for share gain, said HSBC. Shares of SKF India ended up 0.8 per cent at Rs 2191.55 on Thursday.• CLSA has raised target price on Ramco Cements to Rs 1,050 from Rs 970 while retaining a buy recommendation. The brokerage has raised earnings estimates due to betterthan-expected results. CLSA said Ramco Cements remains its preferred pick due to its focus on growth and cost optimisation, although weak cement prices in south and east India are near term concerns. Shares of Ramco Cements ended up 1.1 per cent at Rs 784.25 on Thursday.• Maybank Kim Eng Securities has maintained buy rating on Inox Leisure with a target price of Rs 390.

Shares of Inox Leisure ended up 1 per cent at Rs 364.80 on Thursday.• Edelweiss has maintained buy rating on India Grid Trust with a target price of Rs 113. India Grid Trust reported stable second quarter performance with Rs 3 distribution per unit (DPU), said Edelweiss.

Germany had earlier described the move as India's internal matter and India will seek that support at the highest level when Merkel visits India armed with 12 Ministers.

I don’t know how to live in this country,” he said.SEEKING TIGHTER LAWSTerming the developments as “unprecedented”, privacy experts demanded tighter laws on such surveillance in the country. “It (the government) needs to answer, whether it procured such spyware and why, since under the Telegraph Act or the IT Act there are no powers to install spyware or malware on smartphones,” Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundationtold ET.In a post on October 29, The Citizen Lab — housed in the University of Toronto — said NSO Group’s spyware was being sold to government clients without appropriate controls over how it is used by the clients. “They are, in turn, using NSO’s technology to hack into the devices of members of civil society, including journalists, lawyers, political opposition, and human rights defenders — with potential lethal consequences,” it said.Rathod, who represents several of the accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, including Dalit lawyer Surendra Gadling, told ET that he had suspected his phone was being spied on in 2018 and raised a complaint with WhatsApp in March 2019. Experts contend that surveillance powers in India are not being reconciled with the reality of the Supreme Court’s privacy judgment delivered by a ninejudge bench, and that there is no movement for surveillance reforms either through judicial oversight or parliamentary reporting.‘EXPANSION IN SURVEILLANCE POWER’“There is a tremendous expansion of the existing surveillance power of the government,” said Gupta of IFF, which has challenged in the Supreme Court the December 2018 notification of the home ministry authorising 10 central agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any computer information.Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director and senior international counsel at Access Now, said hacking is a criminal offence under the IT Act. “Last week, the Bombay High Court passed a judgment against the CBI in a corruption case over illegally intercepted conversations and said it is against the Supreme Court order on privacy. The HC said this can be allowed only in the case of public emergency or in the interest of public safety,” he said.Access Now is an international non-profit, human rights, public policy and advocacy group that works towards an open and free internet. It has worked with The Citizen Lab in discovering how activists have been targeted, and tried to direct attention on the human rights concerns around how surveillance tech firms such as NSO Group operate.Trying to put fears at rest, IT minister Prasad said, “Government agencies have a well-established protocol for interception, which includes sanction and supervision from highly ranked officials in central and state governments, for clear stated reasons in national interest.” "," I'm sorry, but there is no summary available for this article.

17,1-11-2019,Inox  Leisure could narrow valuation gap with PVR,"Mumbai: One of the key questions that investors in India’s second largest multiplex operator, Inox Leisure, have is about the prolonged valuation gap between the company and the sector leader PVR. That too when there isn’t any considerable difference between the performance variables of the two companies.According to Bloomberg data, on a one-year forward basis, PVR is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 38.2 against Inox’s 24.13. This amounts to a premium of 58 per cent for PVR, which is far higher than the past three-year average premium of 38 per cent. Why is PVR commanding so much premium?The answer to this can be understood if one takes into account the factors which have helped PVR surge ahead of Inox. Firstly, it is important to understand that the exhibition business is all about locations. It is not just about having screens, but the locations which play a crucial role in making the business highly profitable. On this parameter, largely through a string of acquisitions and with the early mover advantage, PVR (with as many as 771 screens now) earned the premium perception from the Street. Bloomberg Also, thanks to the promoters’ single line of business, periodic acquisitions sent a message to investors that the promoters have been extremely focussed on making it big in the industry. Consequently, PVR's premium story transcended the sector and, in the past few years, the company has evolved into a consumption story rather than just an entertainment industry story.Does Inox have similar factors in its favour to generate strong interest from the Street in the coming quarters? In the past four years, Inox has shown aggression in adding screens (it has close to 600 screens) and boasts of maximum new signings (around 900).Analysts acknowledge the fact that the company has upped its presence in premium locations (at Atria Mall in Mumbai’s Worli, for instance) which gives clarity about the promoters' intention to prove a serious contender to PVR.Inox added 85 screens in FY19 and in the next two years, it is expected to launch another 150 screens. In comparison, PVR has been adding 50-60 screens per year in the past few years. Inox is debt-free and has a promoter holding of 51.8 per cent, as against less than 20 per cent promoter holding for PVR. This means Inox has scope for acquisitions or growing organically to enhance its presence in premium locations.Given these factors, analysts believe that even though the premium in valuations between PVR and Inox will remain, it is likely to narrow in the next one-two years, provided Inox continues to remain focused and market itself well.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy"," The article discusses the valuation gap between Mumbai's second largest multiplex operator, Inox Leisure, and the sector leader PVR.

The estimate for August was revised to 0.1% from a contraction of 0.5% earlier.The eight industries have a 40% weightage in the broader IIP, which may now slump further from a 1.1% contraction in August, its worst performance in over seven years.“We still have a long way for the economy to stabilise,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank, adding that Q2 growth could be marginally lower than in Q1.Recent Data Suggests Turnaround“With the y-o-y performance of several lead indicators worsening in the just-concluded quarter relative to Q1, we anticipate that GDP (gross domestic product) and GVA (gross value added) growth may dip further in Q2, despite a favourable base effect and the cushion provided by lower raw material costs,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA.India’s economy expanded 5% in April-June quarter, the slowest pace in six years, and according to the Reserve Bank of India, is expected to clock a marginally better 5.3% in the July-September quarter. For FY20, growth is forecast to slump to 6.1% from 6.8% in FY19. GDP data for the July-September quarter will be released on November 29.“This shows the broad-based slowdown in the economy and confirms that industrial production in the second quarter will be weak. We also expect second-quarter GDP to be a repeat of the first quarter,” said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.ICRA expects industrial growth to contract 2.5-3.5% in September. The official numbers will be released on November 11.Sakshi Gupta, a senior economist at HDFC Bank, was more optimistic, saying a mild turnaround is likely and second-quarter growth may improve to 5.8%, supported by the rural economy and farm incomes.Recent data such as festive retail sales, currency in circulation and automobile sales suggests the economy may have bottomed out in the July-September quarter, picking up some pace in October, with the rally in the stock markets lifting sentiment.The RBI is expected to reduce rates again in December, given the deterioration in industrial activity. It has already cut the key repo rate by 1.35 percentage points in the current year.The government has taken measures such as slashing corporate tax rates, infusing capital in banks, relaxing foreign direct investment limits for select sectors, supporting real estate and providing liquidity for nonbanking finance companies to lift growth.BROAD-BASED SLOWDOWNAll sectors in the core index, with the exception of fertilisers, posted a contraction. Coal, cement, steel and refinery products were impacted by the prolonged monsoon, Care Ratings said.Coal production fell 21% in September after an 8.6% drop in the previous month, adversely impacting electricity generation, which declined 3.7% in September against a 0.9% fall in August.Crude oil production fell 5.4% from a year ago while natural gas output was 4.9% lower. Refinery production was down 6.7%. Steel output contracted 0.3% and cement shrank 2.1%.The core sector measure grew 1.3% in the first half of FY20 as against 5.5% a year earlier.“Such a low growth in core sector industries has not been witnessed so far in either 2011-12 base or 2004-05 base series.

50,1-11-2019,"Congress, Shiv Sena leaders meet Sharad Pawar amid power tussle","The Shiv Sena on Thursday sent signals that it was exploring options of leading a government in Maharashtra. The development introducing uncertainty to BJP’s government formation in the state came on a day when a Congress delegation met NCP chief Sharad Pawar to seek his party’s nod to support a Sena-led government and Sena leader Sanjay Raut made a “courtesy call” to Pawar at his residence later in the day. Whether Sena was driving a hard bargain or was serious was not certain though.Sena insiders said that it was exploring options of leading a government and party president Uddhav Thackeray mentioned this during a meeting of MLAs, adding that their party was in touch with the Congress and the NCP. Addressing his 56 Sena MLAs at Sena Bhavan who elected Thane MLA Eknath Shinde as its legislature party leader, Thackeray said that the BJP should not think the chief minister’s post was meant for it permanently. He was willing to hold talks with BJP, but for such a thing to happen “the BJP should acknowledge that there was an agreement on a 50:50 power sharing formula with us. How will talks go ahead, and on what basis do we talk, if there is no agreement on the formula that was decided,” Thackeray asked. The Sena has been unhappy with the BJP after it turned down its claim of having a Sena chief minister for 2.5 years.Referring to reports about 13 ministerial berths being offered to the Sena, Thackeray told his MLAs “do not believe rumours” and added that the Sena had not received any proposal from the BJP. The Sena president took offence to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ statement on Diwali that there was no agreement on sharing the chief minister’s post. Uddhav told his MLAs that Fadnavis should not have made the statement and that was why Sena had cancelled talks, even while claiming that it still considered BJP as a friend. He added that the Sena was not desperate to “accept whatever was given by the BJP,” and the government would be stable if the BJP honoured what Amit Shah offered to it earlier. Uddhav said that the mandate was for the two parties and not just for the BJP.Raut too said something similar earlier in the day: “The BJP won 105 seats because it was in an alliance with the Sena.” He slammed BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar who had a few days ago claimed that the Sena was going to be destroyed if it continued in the same path. “May be Mungantiwar was speaking about his own party, it was his guilty consciousness speaking,” Raut said. The Sena had no misunderstanding as Shah and Fadnavis had publicly spoken about power-sharing before the Lok Sabha polls. “They are saying now that the chief minister’s post was not decided. What does a power sharing deal mean then? Is the chief minister’s post an NGO’s post that it is not included in a deal,” he asked."," The Shiv Sena is exploring options of leading a government in Maharashtra, introducing uncertainty to the BJP's government formation in the state.

52,1-11-2019,December 31 set as new deadline for urban India to get ODF status,"The Centre has set December 31 as deadline for urban India to achieve the status of “open defecation free” (ODF), even as some local bodies in West Bengal remain uncooperative in the BJP government's flagship initiative.On October 2, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared rural India Open Defecation Free (ODF). However, 40 urban local bodies of West Bengal are standing in the way of urban India being declared ODF. The ministry of housing and urban affairs, the nodal ministry for Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), however, has now set an internal deadline of December 31 to meet the target.Swachh Bharat Mission director VK Jindal told ET that the ministry will hold a meeting with West Bengal chief secretary and top officials on November 5 to discuss the roadblocks in achieving ODF status. A workshop would also be conducted to explain different technologies and best practices that could be beneficial in meeting the target in two months, he added.“We will keep trying. We will hold a meeting and workshop with West Bengal government officials on November 5. We cannot give up and we need to get the state government to implement this initiative,” Jindal said.This would be the first meeting in 10 months between the Centre and West Bengal on Swachh Bharat Mission. The last meeting had taken place in January earlier this year. ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’, the BJP government’s flagship social welfare programme, has been a bone of contention between the Centre and the Bengal state government. While the state has walked out of several programmes including ‘Ayushman Bharat’, it has said that its own ‘Nirmal Bangla Mission’ predates the Centre’s ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’. The ministry has been keeping regular contact with state government over implementation but the status has not changed over the last few months.According to the ministry’s statistics, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Goa and West Bengal were the slow starters.However, over the last one year, UP, Bihar, Odisha and Goa move fast and achieved good results. Goa, which had been lagging as it had not finalised the design of its community toilets till June, has already been certified ODF.On October 2, the ministry had expected Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare urban India as ODF despite West Bengal’s record, but only rural India was declared ODF. A senior ministry official said, “As far as the ministry is concerned, we have achieved our target on October 2. West Bengal has never cooperated. But we will still pursue the state government.”"," The article reports that the Centre has set December 31 as the deadline for achieving open defecation-free status in urban India, even though some local bodies in West Bengal are standing in the way.

54,1-11-2019,Ravi Gaikwad: Man with a mission,"By Anand Vasu At a time when cricket leagues around the world are under the scanner, whether it is for corruption on the field or non-payment of dues to participants, one league is attempting to stand apart in trying to further a worthy social cause, one that is much needed in India.The Road Safety World Series, which will be played by retired cricketers from five countries — India, Australia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies — has been set up with the express ambition of drawing attention to the damage caused on the roads of India, with an outlook to sensitising the public on the need for more to be done to improve matters.Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Muttiah Muralitharan and Brett Lee will headline the league, to be played in Mumbai from February 4 in 2020, and as many as 110 cricketers from around the world have already committed to taking part.The league will feature 10 matches followed by a final.Putting together a league of this breadth, with the involvement of top stars, even retired ones, from around the world, is no easy task and the man who has been driving it is Ravi Gaikwad, Regional Transport Office (Thane) from Mumbai. He has roped in Sunil Gavaskar as commissioner of the league and Gavaskar’s company, Professional Management Group will run the tournament.Gaikwad’s involvement with cricket is not new. Growing up in Pune, Gaikwad played at the Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels for Maharashtra and went as far as the Ranji camp. However, when the time came to choose between sport and academics, it was the latter that won out, perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Gaikwad was state topper in the Higher Secondary Certificate examinations.Astint in science followed with TATA before Gaikwad joined the RTO.“One thing that runs very deeply in every Indian’s DNA is cricket. The reach of this game and the following of its stars are phenomenal and we want to spread our message through this game which is so close to everyone in this country,” Gaikwad told ET Sport. “If you look at statistics of tragedies on the road in India, you will be shocked. By official estimates one person loses their life on the road every four minutes. Of every 100 fatalities in the world in road accidents, 30 are Indians.”According to the World Resources Institute, the number of road fatalities worldwide could touch 2.2 million by the year 2020, and India accounted for 150,000 fatalities in 2018. The institute estimates that the fatalities cost the country approximately $ 58 billion, which is roughly 3% of its Gross Domestic Product.“Look, there is no doubt that the numbers are serious and more needs to be done. But, let me put it more simply. Each time there is afatality, it is not just one person who is affected,” says Gaikwad. “An entire family is affected, not just from an emotional and mental perspective, but it could be the single breadwinner who has passed away. Just medical expenses put a huge strain on the system. But what people must realise is that in an instant, the course of a family’s entire future is changed forever.”Gaikwad, whose resume includes two registered Guinness Records, one for the largest handball class and another for the largest world safety class, certainly does mind taking on ambitious projects, but he is aware that tremendous support is needed if this current one is to succeed. “All different streams have to come together for something like this,” says Gaikwad. “There are major companies who work in Corporate Social Responsibility, there are individuals who can lend their time and expertise, and, of course, there is the public, at whom the message is ultimately aimed.”The tournament has already secured a broadcast partner in Colours Cineplex and will also be streamed via the Voot and Jio platforms.With a new league springing up in some part of the world almost every month, this is one with an important difference. How it pans out, is going to be a challenge that can only be overcome by all stakeholders coming together."," The article reports on the Road Safety World Series, a cricket league that aims to raise awareness about road safety in India and promote the game of cricket as a means to do so.

56,1-11-2019,Desi demand spices up the Indian SaaS story,"Indian Software as a Service (SaaS) companies are seeing demand for their products grow locally, following years of focus on the United States and European markets.Improved cellphone connectivity, increased digital solutions for Goods and Services Tax (GST) and digital payments are supporting the growing demand.Typically, industries have been slow to adopt digital products, but that is changing as micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) become more tech-savvy and look to improve efficiency through software.Large conglomerates, which have been serviced by global software leaders, are also becoming more open to adopting solutions of Indian SaaS companies, experts and industry watchers say.Software industry lobby group Nasscom said in a recent report that the Indian SaaS market was growing at 36% every year, and is estimated to hit $3.3-3.4 billion by 2022.This will be largely on the back of talent availability, a lower cost workforce and adoption of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to build products, it said.The demand for SaaS from India is not only fuelling growth at companies like Druva, Knowlarity, Icertis and Zoho — which have traditionally focused on the West — but it has also given rise to SaaS startups focused on serving the Indian market.In fact, marquee investor Tiger Global, which has backed consumer firms such as Flipkart and Ola, made its first India investment in the sector in May.Druva, an Indian SaaS unicorn, says it is looking to double headcount in the country to better service local customers.“To keep pace with rising demand, we opened a new innovation centre in Pune in September 2018, and (we) are continuously expanding our sales team,” said Bakshish Dutta, country manager-India and Saarc, Druva.Druva, which offers cloud data protection, is seeing increased growth thanks to Indian companies starting to host their applications on the internet or Cloud.Companies in traditional sectors such as retail, manufacturing and tourism — under pressure from newer tech-savvy companies — are now using technology solutions to remain competitive.Knowlarity Communications, a cloud telephony firm, said it was on track to earn Rs 100 crore from its India operations this year. Its India business had grown by 50% in the first half of the year, CEO Yatish Mehrotra said.Ozonetel, which has always been focused on the domestic market, offers a similar service.“In the past year, there has been an upsurge of interest with more B2B companies coming up,” said Chaitanya Chokkareddy, CIO, Ozonetel.Indian customers, however, need more hands-on support, he said, adding that managing cash flow was the other key challenge since getting payments on time was always a problem for smaller firms.However, another Indian firm that focuses on the call centre contact market, Helpshift, said local demand has not grown all that much.“People don’t see much value in spending on automation of customer service given the easy availability of labour here, so we continue to remain focused on the more mature markets,” said Abinash Tripathy, founder, Helpshift.Be that as it may, the growth in the number of B2B startups, aided by additional investments in the space, has been a key factor driving local growth for SaaS firms.“The change you’re seeing in the last few years is SaaS companies being built to serve the Indian market. Typically, India has not been large for software and even today, I don’t think it pays a fair price for software, but this is evolving,” Naren Gupta, co-founder and MD of Nexus Venture Partners, one of the earliest Indian investors in SaaS, had told ET in a recent interview.  The Indian SaaS market can be divided into three segments, said Suresh Sambandam, CEO of Kissflow, a SaaS platform for enterprise workflow, which has customers in India.One, the really small enterprises with an annual revenue of less than Rs 25 crore, which have limitations in adopting technology due to it being owner-driven businesses. Two, the medium-sized companies of up to Rs 100 crore, and last, those that are bigger, which can invest in software to improve business and that is the real market in India, according to Sambandam.“This market is a small number,” he said. “You can’t go and sell to them. It is a painful process. We do marketing and they come to us. They look at pricing, reach out to us and use our software”.In the past few months, two Indian SaaS startups — Druva and Icertis — have raised funds at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Both these firms have large teams in Pune, and have been growing their domestic presence aggressively.“Icertis opened two new offices in the Apac region – Singapore and Sydney – to accommodate the rapid growth we are seeing among companies throughout Asia. We don’t expect that to slow down anytime soon,” said CEO Samir Bodas. In India, the company works with brands like Airtel, Infosys and Cognizant, and local operations are driving growth within the Apac region. Small firms first made the transition from pen and paper to software with the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), said Hyther Nizam, VP-product management at Chennai-based SaaS firm Zoho.The GST Network allowed small businesses to download free software from select vendors, including Zoho, for their GST-filing process. “India is currently the number one fastest-growing market for the company, growing at 2.5 times the average global growth. While new revenue growth is in triple digits, the contribution of India to the overall revenue has gone up two times in the last two years,” Nizam said.However, Indian customers need a lot more hand-holding, and the evaluation cycles also tend to be much longer, he said. Other homegrown companies also feel the India growth story could increase visibility and help them target a large base of potential users. “For us, reaching out to every nook and corner and to three million taxpayers who have a turnover of Rs 1.5 crore and below would not have been easy. So, we thought it could help us get more visibility,” Nitin Patel, director, Relyon Softech, which offers Saral Accounts, a GST software, had said in a recent interview.Zoho has also created a separate programme to work with local SME bodies as well as government-incubated startups, to further broaden its presence in that segment. Zoho said it will work to tap companies in tier-2 and tier-3 towns starting next year."," Great summary! To add on, the Indian SaaS market is also seeing growth from larger conglomerates which have been serviced by global software leaders but are now becoming more open to adopting solutions of Indian SaaS companies. This shift is being driven by a desire for improved efficiency and cost savings through technology adoption. Additionally, with the rise of cloud computing and digital transformation, there is an increasing need for scalable and flexible software solutions that can meet the unique needs of businesses across various industries. As a result, more established companies are looking to invest in SaaS products as part of their overall strategy to stay competitive and improve their bottom line. Overall, the Indian SaaS market has great potential for growth and is expected to continue expanding at a rapid pace due to the country's large pool of micro, small, and medium-sized businesses, increasing demand for digital solutions, and improving infrastructure for cloud computing and data storage."

61,1-11-2019,Uttar Pradesh suspends order adding 17 OBCs to SC list,"After getting slammed by the Allahabad High Court last month, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has suspended its order, and two earlier orders issued by the preceding Akhilesh Yadav government, which had shifted 17 Other Backward Castes (OBCs) to the Scheduled Caste (SC) list.The UP government has written to all district magistrates informing them that the three orders have been suspended, following the high court directive, and that all caste certificates in the state will be issued only as per the presidential notification issued in respect to the state. The UP government specified in the letter that no caste certificates will be issued on the basis of the three orders it had issued earlier.The move to shift the 17 OBCs into the SC list, before the UP bypolls, was challenged by a petitioner before the Allahabad High Court. In its order on September 16, the court said, “It has been contended that the benefit of reservation to SC, ST and OBC can be made available only to those caste which are mentioned in the presidential notification and state government has no authority to add or subtract anyone or to clarify any entry in presidential notification so as to include or exclude any particular caste… and state government’s orders dated 22.12.16, 21.12.16 and 24.06.19 are wholly without jurisdiction.”The UP government cited an earlier high court order of 2017, saying it had mentioned that caste certificates can be issued subject to the outcome of an earlier writ petition pending before the court, to issue a fresh order on June 24, bringing 17 OBCs into the SC list.However, the high court September 16 order was critical of the UP government’s move. “Let respondent 3 (UP secretary) file a personal affidavit to explain under what provision aforesaid government orders have been issued. Until further orders of the court, we clarify that caste certificate should be issued strictly in accordance with Presidential notification and no certificate be issued pursuant to government orders dated 22.12.16, 21.12.16 and 24/06.2019,” said the order. The case will be heard next at the Allahabad High Court in November. The Akhilesh Yadav government had issued two similar orders in 2016 which were also challenged in the high court through a public interest litigation."," The Uttar Pradesh government has suspended its earlier orders that shifted 17 Other Backward Castes (OBCs) to the Scheduled Caste (SC) list, following the Allahabad High Court's order last month.

For airlines also, sometimes the OTA offers are cheaper than what you get on airline websites but, airlines are not complaining because they are getting their money,” said the head of an OTA on condition of anonymity. “The inclusion could be a good thing from a regulatory point of view to put some sense into businesses that businesses should not be focused on gross merchandise value alone but should also be sustainable and profitable after a point,” he added."," The article reports that the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) and LocalCircles, a social media platform, have written to the commerce ministry and the ministry of consumer affairs to bring all travel and accommodation marketplaces under the e-commerce rules.

70,1-11-2019,Billionaire families reshape Silicon Valley’s venture terrain,"If you’re a startup, tech entrepreneur or venture capitalist there’s a good chance you do business with Silicon Valley Bank. The lender’s clients include half of all venture capital-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the U.S. and 67% of companies that went public last year with VC support.The Santa Clara-based bank isn’t just courting tech whizzes. It’s increasingly focusing on the mega-wealthy family offices that are reshaping the landscape of venture investing. More than 1,500 direct venture deals were done by such outfits over the past five years, according to data provider Fintrx. Prominent examples in recent months include Tony James of Blackstone Group Inc. investing in fintech startup Alto and India’s Azim Premji leading a $115 million funding round in enterprise software maker Icertis.Jacqueline von Reichbauer, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. private banker who led a single family office before joining SVB in 2018, heads the lender’s family office practice. VonReichbauer, 37, discussed the increasing appetite for early-stage investing among families, Silicon Valley’s global appeal and the recent travails of the IPO market this month with Bloomberg. Her comments have been edited and condensed.Why are families upping their venture investments?First, there’s so much capital available at the later stage for private companies that returns broadly are relocating from public to private markets. Companies can now stay private significantly longer than they used to. So if you’re a family that wants to participate in some of the returns that are being generated by these companies, you have to participate.The second reason is that we’ve also seen a massive uptick in innovation in old-guard industries. So the traditional definition of tech has completely eroded. Look at a company like Sweetgreen raising $150 million on a $1.6 billion valuation. That’s not traditional tech as we saw it a decade ago. Now you’re looking at food and agriculture and beauty and construction. All of these older-guard industries are facing disruption from venture-backed companies.How deep-pocketed are some of these family offices?We’re coming across families that are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into individual companies. Families that are independently taking billion-dollar-plus companies private; families that are really morphing in both form and function into what looks like more of a venture fund than a traditional family office. We have families that are participating at such late stages and putting such large dollar values to work that they’re even expressing frustration over the competition they’re seeing from the SoftBanks of the world.It’s hard to express how significant and powerful some of these families are becoming in this ecosystem. They’re building massive venture portfolios in some cases. A family I was with a week and a half ago are putting $1.5 billion to work in venture alone.What’s their appetite for venture?At the very high end we’re seeing families where the vast majority of their balance sheet is in venture. So call it 60%-, 70%-plus. Those extremes are often particularly true for families that have a background in technology that generated their wealth through the world of startups.They’re independently institutionalizing. They’re building multibillion-dollar allocations on their own. There are families that are building incubators and accelerators and even in one case funding innovation from the ground up in an Edison lab-like campus. It’s pretty wild some of the extremes that we’re seeing.How does this play out globally?There’s a slightly riskier posture that U.S. based families take. Broadly speaking, North American families have more of a growth posture on their balance sheet. That being said, the percentage of billionaire families that are investing in venture is greatest in Asia. So over 70% of billionaire families in Asia are investing in venture, which is higher than what we’re seeing in the U.S. and Europe, where that number is kind of sub-60%.You help these families network?We can step in and provide a place for families to connect and engage where they do have this shared commitment to venture. Families syndicate with one another, they’re sharing opportunities and deals and perspectives on managers. There’s a lot of that information flow happening because these families trust one another and they share the same type of differentiation as a pool of capital. So if there are opportunities for them to work together, they want to.Is the weakness of the IPO market an issue?There’s a lot of conversation around the WeWorks of the world, Peloton going out down 11%. But if you look at these companies -- Peloton, Datadog, CloudFlare, CrowdStrike, Pinterest, Zoom, Beyond Meat -- regardless of some of the public market performance, there’s an incredible story about great gains and return generation for those that did invest when the company was private.I’m not hearing negative feedback from families who are too concerned about the public market activity. For those participating early, hiccups when companies hit the public markets aren’t a reason to pull back. If anything, it’s more reason to invest in venture."," The article discusses how Silicon Valley Bank's clients include half of all venture capital-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the U.S. and 67% of companies that went public last year with VC support.

72,1-11-2019,"Twitter's move to ban political advertising unlikely to impact India: Campaigners, advertisers","NEW DELHI: Advertisers and digital campaigners for national political parties said Twitter's move to ban all political advertising across markets is unlikely to make much of an impact in India as political parties do not use paid, promoted tweets to advertise on the platform and that a chunk of political advertising in the country is cornered by Google and Facebook. Amit Malviya, in charge of BJP's national information and technology said the party is 'quite indifferent' to Twitter's decision to ban political ads as 'its strength on the platform is completely organic.' Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessISB Digital TransformationVisitIIM LucknowIIML Executive Programme in FinTech, Banking & Applied Risk ManagementVisitMITMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisitOn Wednesday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the company was banning political advertising as internet political advertising presents new challenges to civic discourse including unchecked misleading information and deep fakes at an increasing velocity and overwhelming scale.Dorsey's announcement comes in the wake of rival social media platform Facebook facing intense scrutiny in Congressional hearings in the United States because of its stance on running political ads with false claims this month.“Principally, it is a good thing. Jack Dorsey has stated that political message reach should be earned and not bought. But I don’t think this will have any impact in India as a major chunk of political ads in India go to Google and Facebook which make the most money on political ads as their reach is also much more. If Facebook and Google follow suit, the impact will be enormous,” said political social media strategist Naresh Arora, director of DesignBoxed, a political digital campaign management company, which was one of the agencies hired by Congress for the 2019 general elections.Twitter did not respond to ET’s queries on the implications of the move in India but referred to Dorsey’s tweet thread. Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesIn a series of Tweets on Wednesday, Dorsey said while internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risk to politics where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions. Dorsey said Twitter will enforce the new policy by November 22, to provide current advertisers a notice period before this change goes into effect. “Nobody in India buys political ads on Twitter. In India, the political usage of Twitter is primarily to trend things. The trending is not done through Twitter’s paid ads but usually by buying or creating influencers and roping in agencies to get to a certain volume of tweets,” said Kapil Gupta, chief executive of OMLogic Consulting, which has worked on campaigns for BJP, Congress, Lok Dal and Akali Dal in the past.“There could be a distinct impact if Twitter says it will clamp down on political promotions on twitter which essentially involve tracking the visibility of people when they are in political conversations, the trending that happens through same profiles talking about different political topics everyday. Then, the political parties will need to rethink their political strategies,” he added.Digital marketing professional Manveer Singh Malhi, who has worked on political campaigns in the past, said Twitter has lost out on political ads to platforms like Facebook and Google as the latter offer more sophisticated and efficient micro targeting tools.“If you compare factors like geo location, compared to platforms like Google, Twitter is quite weak. On Facebook and Google, I can target users via pin codes, by miles, radius. A local politician would need that,” Malhi.Political analyst Gaurav Pandhi said promoted content costs on Twitter turn out to be very expensive and very ineffective compared to Facebook. I have not seen any political party using promotions on Twitter. This could lead to people pressing Facebook to doing it too and if Facebook stops political advertising it will hugely impact political parties.”"," The article reports that Twitter's move to ban all political advertising across markets is unlikely to make much of an impact in India as political parties do not use paid, promoted tweets to advertise on the platform. This sentiment was echoed by political social media strategist Naresh Arora who said, ""If Facebook and Google follow suit, the impact will be enormous."" Additionally, Kapil Gupta opined that Twitter's ban on political ads in India would affect trends and not political campaigns as it is primarily used for trending. Manveer Singh Malhi also shared his concerns about the effectiveness of Twitter's advertising tools compared to other platforms like Facebook and Google, stating that local politicians do not use promoted content on Twitter. Finally, Gaurav Pandhi noted that political parties in India do not use paid promotions on Twitter, which could lead to a shift in political strategies if Twitter implements its new policy."

79,1-11-2019,"In Haryana, Manohar Lal-Chautala bonhomie on display","The BJP may be finding it tough to strike an amicable deal in Maharashtra with its oldest ally, Shiv Sena, but in Haryana the new post-poll allies, Manohar Lal of the BJP and Dushyant Chautala of the JJP, are displaying perfect bonhomie after running a bitter campaign against each other in the run-up to the assembly election.On Thursday, Chief Minister Manohar Lal flagged off a ‘Run for Unity’ in Panchkula while deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala flagged off the event from Gurgaon and spoke glowingly about Sardar Patel’s role in unifying the country. Chautala later visited the civil hospital in Gurgaon to inspect facilities for patients and passed directions for improvement.On Wednesday in Delhi, Chautala took care to follow protocol and met the President Ram Nath Kovind, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh after CM Manohar Lal had met them.He was due back in Chandigarh soon to take charge as the deputy CM at Haryana Civil Secretariat where Room Number 40 on the fifth floor had been readied for him. This room was occupied so far by Captain Ambhimanyu, finance minister in the first BJP government in the state and widely considered the number two in the previous government, who lost the election this time. The CM’s office is on the fourth floor in this building. Chautala could also be allotted the house which Abhimanyu earlier occupied.Lal has acknowledged two key ideas of Chautala and rolled them out promptly. One was an organic decomposer that Chautala championed in his constituency by which farm stubble decomposes on its own using an organic solution. At the first Cabinet meeting of the new government on Tuesday in Delhi at Haryana Bhawan, which only Lal and Chautala attended since rest of the ministers were yet to be named and sworn in, a 50% subsidy was announced on the organic solution if farmers across the state buy it rather than burn the stubble.Another concern of Chautala was examination centres for competitive exams existing at far-off places in Haryana which led to casualties of some candidates earlier. The Cabinet decided that state competitive exams will now have centres within 50 km.It is expected that Chautala would campaign for the BJP in the upcoming Delhi assembly election, especially on seats that border Haryana and have a substantial Jat population. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) had earlier contested the Najafgarh seat in Delhi and lost it narrowly. Allocation of ministerial posts is still pending in Haryana though, with the JJP eyeing at least two more ministerial positions besides plum portfolios for Chautala such as finance, agriculture or health."," The article reports that despite being an ally to the BJP, Shiv Sena may be finding it tough to strike an amicable deal in Maharashtra.

80,1-11-2019,Sebi asks banks to declare NPA divergences on continuous basis,"Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked banks to disclose any material divergences in their non-performing assets on a continuous basis.In a circular issued on Thursday, the market regulator said banks must disclose such information within 24 hours of the receipt of the Reserve Bank of India’s risk assessment report. Currently, such divergences are disclosed by banks in their quarterly financial results.The new rules will apply to situations where the additional provisioning for NPAs assessed by the RBI exceeds 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and contingencies. The disclosure rules will also apply if the additional gross NPAs identified by the central bank exceed 15 per cent of the published incremental gross NPAs for the reference period.“These disclosures in respect of divergence and provisioning are in the nature of material events/ information and hence necessitate immediate disclosure,” said the Sebi circular. “Further, this information is also price-sensitive, requiring prompt disclosure.”These new provisions have been brought by the regulator to align its rules with those of the RBI. The central bank had issued new regulations for disclosure of divergence in asset classification in April. Previously, banks were required to disclose divergence if the provisioning needed was more than 15 per cent of the net profit. The RBI lowered this to 10 per cent in an April circular and Sebi has incorporated this in its new rules.In 2017-18, several leading banks reported divergence in NPAs in terms of their own assessment compared with the RBI’s assessment. These discrepancies were disclosed in the quarterly results and the share prices fell sharply in response to the disclosure, prompting Sebi to consider changing the framework.In order to bring more transparency in terms of NPA disclosures, Sebi had issued a circular in 2017 asking all listed companies to disclose any loan defaults within 24 hours of the event. Some of the leading banks opposed the circular, forcing the market regulator to withdraw it.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy"," The article discusses how the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked banks to disclose any material divergences in their non-performing assets on a continuous basis.

81,1-11-2019,View: India needs $1 trillion exports to become a $5 trillion economy,"By Ram SinghHigh export growth rate is crucial for India’s goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025. To achieve this objective, the economy will have to grow at an average rate of 8% during the next four years. India’s exports will have to grow at an even higher rate.The current slowdown has made the objective more challenging, with India’s exports having shrunk 6.57% in September. Moreover, GoI has to take a call on whether to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the free trade grouping of 10 Asean members and their six allies. The group continues to pressure India on finalising the deal by November 4, even though several industry and trade organisations have increased the pitch of their opposition to the agreement.Free Up Trade AgreementsIn view of the stakes involved, the report of the high-level advisory group (HLAG) set up by the ministry of commerce could not have come at a more opportune time. The report presents a roadmap to double India’s exports to $1 trillion by 2025 from about $500 billion at present. To achieve this, it suggests a slew of measures, some of which have been much talked about in the past. These include reducing the cost of capital by further lowering repo rates.However, the main focus is on raising competitiveness of Indian exports. Moreover, it makes bold recommendations on several issues traditionally considered to be risky economically and sensitive politically, such as free trade deals.In principle, by promoting exports, free trade agreements (FTAs) can help the country move up the value chain. That, in turn, can provide India an edge vis-à-vis non-member countries. However, the fact remains that we have not gained from existing FTAs. The main culprits are the non-tariff barriers and administrative hurdles faced by Indian exporters such as difficulty in quality and specification certificates, and time-consuming custom clearances, just to name a couple. They have prevented Indian exporters from exploiting markets of trading partners. Unsurprisingly, the partner countries have gained more.Moreover, due to corruption and lax quality control, several cheap but poor quality goods, especially from China, have flooded the market. These are bad for India’s health, environment and balance of trade.The FTAs, in themselves, do not address these problems. For Indian exports, the logistical bottlenecks are other stumbling blocks. The turnaround time at the best of Indian ports like Kochi is two-three time longer than for Chinese ports. We come a cropper even compared to our Asian competitors like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Shipping of garments from point of origin to the nearest port can take as much as seven times longer in India than in Bangladesh, and as much as 20 times than in Vietnam. Unsurprisingly, India falls well below its potential in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), crucial for raising exports. To a large extent, China’s spectacular performance on the export front is on account of FDI, whose share is estimated to be over 50% in China’s manufactured exports.Export Hard, Bargain HarderReportedly, many companies are considering moving out of China, since the start of the US-China trade war. However, not many are keen to relocate to India. To overcome this hurdle, the HLAG report proposes a centralised authority for issuing licences, and to empower it to grant incentives for companies meeting pre-defined criteria.While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has helped fix part of the mess from the past, contract enforcement in India still leaves much to be desired. Judicial delays, coupled with the lack of appreciation of the economic consequences of delayed decisions, call for a clear and consistent legal and regulatory framework to guide judicial decision-making. Moreover, GoI would need to negotiate hard on non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian companies from accessing markets of trading partners, such as the requirement of local experience by China.Addressing these issues, and having a staggered timeline, can reduce the risks of entering into an FTA. The proposal to fund infrastructure using long-term bond market, though spot on, will work only if the regulatory framework for grading of projects is in place beforehand. Several other measures will help.Consider the issue of land. GoI owns large tracts of unused land. The ministries of railways and defence have upward of 43,000 and 33,000 hectares of idle land respectively. The case is similar for major airports, power plants and other public sector utilities (PSUs), a large part of which is in prime areas or near cities, such as the 31,886 hectares of idle land owned by special economic zones (SEZs). This land should be utilised for omnipresent infrastructural demands, investment projects and multi-model logistics hubs.Creation of big data-driven prediction systems for Indian exports will help in identifying priority areas. In fact, big data and artificial intelligence (AI) also have the potential to serve as a source of new exports to the developed world. Councils along the lines of goods and services tax (GST) councils may be a good idea for developing logistical hubs and value added exports of agricultural products.The pathway to $1trillion exports is bumpy. But the recommendations, backed by the above policy actions, will go a long way in promoting exports and increasing share of manufacturing in the GDP and total employment.The writer is professor, Delhi School of Economics."," The article discusses how India's goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025 requires an average export growth rate of 8% during the next four years.

93,1-11-2019,How to understand and read benefit illustration before buying a life insurance policy,"Have you ever asked the insurance sales agent to show you the policy benefits illustration while buying a life insurance policy? The 5-10 page life insurance benefit illustration is aimed at helping you understand how the return on your policy money/amount of investable portion of premium is computed.You must know that it is the investable portion of the premium that earns the return and not the total premium which you pay. So, when you pay premium for an insurance policy, several charges are deducted towards mortality, GST, fund management charges (FMC) if any, etc., and only the balance premium gets invested. The benefit illustration basically shows how returns on the money invested will be earned/calculated. The projected investment rate of return shown in the benefit illustration can be guaranteed as well as non-guaranteed. Therefore, you should read it carefully.1. How to understand whether the rates of return(s) are guaranteed or non-guaranteedA guaranteed rate of return on your investment means that the investment will grow as shown and the insured will receive the invested amount as stated in the benefit illustration. Also, if the life insurance policy offers guaranteed benefits, then it is clearly marked as 'guaranteed' in the benefit illustration table.On the other hand, the non-guaranteed projected rate of return on your investment is dependent on the performances of the investments, therefore, the rate is assumed in the policy benefit illustration.Rakesh Goyal, Director, Probus Insurance brokers said, ""Usually, a policy benefit illustration will show guaranteed and non-guaranteed returns. The death benefits and other guaranteed returns, as mentioned, are real. Whereas, the non-guaranteed returns are variable as they are a reflection of the projected investment rate of return based on the assumption of 4 percent per annum and 8 percent per annum on investment."" Also read: IRDAI issues new norms to curb life insurance misselling, makes illustrations mandatoryThe regulator has standardised the projected rates of return on the invested amount which are to be taken in the benefit illustration to show projected investment growth throughout the term of the policy. These assumed rate of return (gross yield) show how the fund grows after deducting all the charges.C S Sudheer, Founder & CEO, IndianMoney.com said, ""You must remember that the published gross yield to project investment growth in the benefit illustration is not a true reflection of the rate of return as it excludes mortality cost, Good and Services Tax (GST) and costs for offering a guarantee if any.""What you must knowa) In a benefit illustration, gross yield is calculated as a percentage (8 percent and 4 percent) based on the portion of premium invested on a year-on-year basis and the net yield is calculated as a certain percentage on the maturity amount.As per the regulator, for insurance policies with term above 10 years, the net reduction in yield should not be more than 2.25 percent at maturity. And for insurance policies with term less than or equal to 10 years, the net reduction in yield should not be more than 3 percent at maturity. For instance, if you take a policy for a term of more than 10 years, the post-cost return on the maturity will be at least 5.75 percent at an 8 percent per annum gross return/yield.Also, the net reduction in yield does not factor in/take into account the mortality charges, which can eat into your investments at higher ages and sum assured, taxes and costs of guarantees, if any.Therefore, in reality, the post-cost return on the investible portion of the premium paid will be calculated on the basis of net yield. So, when you read the benefit illustration make sure you know how much net yield has been calculated on your invested amount. The calculation of net yield is mentioned in the policy benefit illustration table. Since the net yield is derived from gross yield in the policy benefit illustration, it is also not real. However, it will give you a fair idea of how much net return you will earn on the gross return actually earned on the investible portion of the premium paid. This is how net yield calculation in a policy benefit illustration table is shown Particulars  Projected investment rate of return (percentage)  Gross Yield  8 (non-guaranteed return)  Net Reduction in Yield (This excludes reduction due to GST, mortality charges, morbidity charges, rider charges and guaranteed benefit charges, if any)  1.19  Net Yield (This excludes reduction due to GST, mortality charges, morbidity charges, rider charges and guaranteed benefit charges if any) *  6.81  Net Yield (This includes GST at 18% and all charges) *  6.55 * The yields shown above do not take partial withdrawals into consideration.Sudheer said, ""In the case of assuming return at 8 percent per annum, if the policy illustration shows net yield as around 6.5 percent, then the impact of charges is 1.5 percent. This means that charges have eaten into gross returns lowering the net yield. Higher the charges, lower will be the net yield.""b) The insurance sales agent cannot assume any rate of return on their own to show you exaggerated investment projection at the time of selling an insurance policy. Make sure that they are showing you the standard benefit illustration prepared by Irdai mandated actuaries (professionals dealing with the measurement and management of risk and uncertainty involved in the policy) of the insurance company.Also read: Why it is important to understand the benefit illustration when buying life insurance?2. How to read insurance policy benefit illustrationAll life insurance benefit illustrations broadly show details of an insured person, life insurance product features (such as policy term, the sum assured, premiums to be paid - policy term, mode of payment, etc.), investment options and policy riders, if any, on the top of the benefit illustration guide. If you opt for a unit-linked insurance plan (ULIPs), the benefit illustration clearly states: ""The investment risk in the investment portfolio in the policy is borne by the policyholder.""Here is a sample of a life insurance benefit illustrationXYZ Savings insurance plan Date of Illustration - 21/10/2019 Personal Details  Product Features  Investment Options  Name of the life insured  ABC  Policy term  15 Years  Secure fund  0%  Age of life insured at the inception of the policy  28 Years  Premium paying term  15 Years  Balanced fund  80%  Gender of the life insured  Male  Premium payment mode  Monthly  Growth super fund  0%  Name of policyholder  ABC  Modal premium  Rs 3,000  Growth fund  0%  Age of policyholder at the inception of the policy  28 Years  Annualised premium  Rs 36,000  High growth fund  20%  Gender of policyholder  Male  Sum assured of the base policy  Rs 3,60,000  Dynamic fund allocation  No  Policyholder residential state  New Delhi  Life cover multiple  10 time of Sum assured  Death benefit option  As applicable Further, the benefit illustration clearly shows how the total premium paid per year is directed/used towards investment, charges and GST of the life insurance plan each year separately in different columns. This way you will know how much amount is invested, paid for charges and left (fund value/wealth creation) at the end of the year.Also read: 5 important points to remember while reading policy benefit illustrationThe following table provides year-by-year statements of various charges and benefits over the duration of the policy with the assumed rate of return as mentioned: ET Online *FMC means Fund Management ChargesThe benefit illustration also has a column which shows the surrender value if you choose to opt-out at different time periods. Goyal said, ""Surrender value is an important number. Generally, surrender costs are expensive in most life insurance policies, and one should avoid surrendering the policy."" The death benefit is clearly calculated/mentioned in a separate column. ET Online The Part 1 and Part 2 of Scenario 1 is only an illustrative document. The benefits if guaranteed, are clearly marked so. For variable benefits, the assumed investment growth rate of 8 percent is used only as an illustration.Similar to the above table there will be another table in the benefit illustration which will provide investment projections with rate of return assumed at 4 percent per annum.Also read: Should you opt for ULIP with minimum sum assured?This way, the benefit illustration of life insurance plans shows how the investable portion of your premium paid grows during the policy period. You also get an idea of how the charges are applied at various stages during the policy term.It is basically a year-by-year summary of the costs and benefits of the life insurance plan. Thus, you can assess the impact of the cost of the life insurance plan on your corpus each year and hence, you can make an informed decision on increasing/decreasing premiums and sum assured to meet specific financial goals.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy",Hello!

95,1-11-2019,Why understanding benefit illustration is important when buying life insurance?,"Misselling in the insurance sector is rampant where unaware customers are sold products not suitable for them. Although there are insurance sales agents that help you choose the right policies as per your need and lifestyle, there are many unscrupulous insurance sales agents who try to sell life insurance by misrepresenting facts in the benefit illustration.When buying life insurance, the insurance agent or insurer is supposed to provide you with a benefit illustration. This illustration should be studied carefully as it shows how the returns on your life insurance policy would be computed and also the level of returns where these are guaranteed.There are many insurance sales agents who sell life insurance policies showing their own policy illustration (with exaggerate rate of return) and not showing the authorised benefit illustration to the customers. Therefore, it's important for policy buyers to read and understand this illustration properly.In case of policies with variable/non-guaranteed returns (e.g ULIPs), the IRDAI has mandated that benefit illustrations must show returns computation based on both 4 % and 8% rates of return.C S Sudheer, Founder & CEO - IndianMoney.com said that insurance sales agents are known to exaggerate returns when selling life insurance plans especially in case of unit-linked plans. These agents promise high returns and entice customers especially when the stock market is doing well. Insurers must compulsorily show customised benefit illustrations assuming gross investment returns of 4 percent per annum and 8 percent per annum. ""You must understand that these assumed rates are standardised by the regulator."" He said, ""You must clearly understand this and not give the sales agent an opportunity to promise unrealistic returns or make use of the policy illustration to trick you. (This happens if you don't understand the policy benefit illustration).""Also read: How to understand and read life insurance benefit illustration before buying life insuranceWhat is a life insurance policy illustration?A life insurance policy illustration is a set of projections, prepared by the actuaries of the insurance company. The benefit illustration basically shows how your (policyholders') insurance policy fund/money invested will perform over a period of time. It includes financial projections for every year until the maturity, throughout the policy term. However, these set of projections are based on certain assumptions and do not guarantee how much your policy will be worth in any given particular year, except where values are clearly stated as 'guaranteed.'Also, be aware that a benefit illustration will not be relevant in case of a pure term insurance policy because it does not provide any return. The money charged for pure term insurance is entirely used to meet mortality risk charges of life insurance and no part of the money is invested. Consequently, there are no 'returns' in a pure term life insurance. The benefits in such an insurance would comprise the coverage of the policy, i.e., the benefits to the nominees in case of death of the insured. Be aware of this IRDAI rulingThe Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has directed insurers to mandatorily issue benefit illustrations (for policies with variable returns) based on two different assumed rates of return (4 percent per annum and 8 percent per annum) as per a prescribed format. Insurers have to comply with the above by December 1, 2019.Thus, where the regulator is taking proactive measures to safeguard buyers, the buyers should also make sure that unscrupulous sales agents don't hoodwink them into buying unsuitable policies based on unrealistic promises.Also read: Don't fall for these 5 common Ulip sales pitchesWhat you should doNext time you talk to an insurance sales agent, ask them for a benefit illustration (as per the IRDAI format) for the insurance policy you are buying.

You can still raise a complaint even after the free-look period is over.

96,1-11-2019,Learning from creative people at work: Purposeful inquiry as core to investing,"Twenty years ago, 12 American academics published a collection of studies tracing the intellectual development of giants like Einstein, Darwin, Faraday, Lavoisier, Beethoven and Wordsworth. This intense study of creative people yields rich learnings. At the core of creativity is a heavy duty memory, a multiplicity of projects, stimulating company and a willingness to work at perfecting your craft for decades on end.“…it is a truism to say that the creative person is unique, since that is true for every human being. But the key point is that the student of creative work makes the understanding of that uniqueness the central goal of the investigation. If there is to be a scientific understanding of creative people, it cannot be limited to those few things we may find common in some creative people. Instead, we must search for a general approach to the description and understanding of unique, creative people.” Doris Wallace & Howard Gruber in ‘Creative People at Work: Twelve Cognitive Case Studies’’ (1989)Learnings from experts’ study of creativityWhatever our abilities might be, British neuroscientist Sarah-Jayne Blakemore has shown that we can improve regardless of our age because of the trainability, the plasticity of the human brain. An especially exciting area of learning is around enhancing our creativity and improving our ability to think originally. American academic Adam Grant’s exceptional book on this subject ‘Originals: How Non-Conformists Change the World’ (2016) has been a rich source of learning for us. We learnt from Grant that “original thinkers – in investing and beyond – have wide-ranging interests beyond their profession, have a yearning to alter the status quo and a high rate of idea generation.”Adam Grant’s book refers to an older, more detailed study of creativity conducted by a dozen American academics in 1989. Creative People at Work: Twelve Cognitive Case Studies is an engrossing study of the greatest minds of the last 500 years. The book traces in detail the education and step-by-step intellectual development of giants like Alfred Einstein, Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, Antoine Lavoisier, Hans Krebs, Beethoven and William Wordsworth. What did they study? For how long? Who were their friends and their sounding boards? How did they juggle multiple projects? How did they deal with setbacks?Both Originals and Creative People at Work say that there is no cut & dried recipe for creativity. Nor is there is a fixed set of personality traits that indicate whether one person will be more or less creative than her neighbour. Both books stress that creativity is the result of purposeful, determined and sustained effort rather than being the result – as the popular preconception goes – of a lightbulb going off in the head of a genius.So what then are the most reliable methods to juice up creativity? Here are our learnings from Creative People at Work (CPW).Five methods to enhance creativity1. Memory: One of the most fascinating aspects of creativity is how dependent it is on memory. Beethoven wrote that “I carry my thoughts about with me for a very long time, often for a very long time before writing them down. I can… be sure that… I shall not forget [a theme] even years later. I change many things, discard others and try again and again until I am satisfied; then in my head I begin to elaborate the work…the underlying idea never deserts me. It rises, it grows. I hear and see the image in front of me from every angle…” (Source: Beethoven: Letters and Journals and Conversations (1952) by M.Hamburger).In our December 10, 2018 blog, we elaborated upon how psychologists have demonstrated that memory is a type of intelligence. In fact, intelligence is nothing more than a specialised bank of memories. In his landmark book Thinking, Fast & Slow’ (2011), Danny Kahneman famously says: “Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find the relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.”That, in turn, leads us to delve into how creative people enhance their memories so that their recall is richer and deeper than that of the average person.Henry Roediger, who runs the Memory Lab at the University of Washington at St Louis, has found that “memory champions” have high cognitive ability. “We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory at all, but of attention”.Simply put, people who have developed their memories to a very high level have highly developed “attentional control”, i.e. the ability to maintain heightened focus on essential information for long periods of time. In other words, a side-effect of the effort that these champions put into memorising stuff is that they learn to concentrate for extended periods of time.This ability can be then usefully applied to any task requiring deep concentration.2. Wide reading alongside deep education: If just reading around widely was all that it took to be creative, then we would have millions of newspaper readers and social media junkies bursting with fresh ideas. Instead, creativity, it would appear, arises from gaining mastery of one’s discipline by using a very specific style of reading/education. We call it the “T-shaped” model of brain development i.e. the creative masters read around extensively while educating/training themselves intensively in a specific field.CPW explains how Albert Einstein used this model of mastery to generate the insight which ultimately led to his “special theory of relativity, a monumental achievement…[for] a single scientist working alone and out of the academic mainstream.”Experts who have sought to understand how Einstein cracked this puzzle have broken his problem-solving into two parts.Step 1 was a thought experiment that Einstein conducted when he was just 16 years old. This thought experiment contained the seeds to cracking the problem of special relativity. In Einstein’s own words from his autobiographical notes, “a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of 16: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity C (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic field at rest, though spatially oscillating. There seems to be no such thing, however, neither on the basis of experience nor according to Maxwell’s equations.From the very beginning, it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the first observer know or be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion?One sees in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained. Einstein’s thought experiment highlighted a paradox with utmost simplicity: either I am moving with the beam of light with velocity C or I am at rest. I cannot be in both states at the same time.Step 2 is Einstein proceeding to crack this paradox over the next 11 years, thus helping the world understand how light travels and more generally, how objects – including celestial bodies – move in a world where gravitational effects are negligible.CPW contends that Einstein’s ability to hit upon the novel thought experiment in Step 1 was greatly helped not just by his (fairly conventional) schooling in Germany and then Italy, but also by: (a) his extensive discussions with his uncle, Caesar Koch, who would spend hours discussing complex maths problems with his teenage nephew; and (b) his special schooling in Switzerland in a Kantonsschule, which specialised in Anschauung i.e. intuition or ‘apprehension or immediate perception that involves fewest elements of rational insight’.Einstein’s success in Step 2 was also underpinned not just by his conventional university education in Zurich Polytechnic, but also the inputs he received on his scientific papers from his uncle. Furthermore, through his teenage years Einstein absorbed the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, the father of Anschauung, who propounded that all of us possess not just intellect but also intuition.Kant famously argued that the objects we see around us are just “mere representations and not as things in themselves.” Kant’s exhortation to think about the world in abstract terms and nail down truths which are independent of what we have experienced in our day-to-day life had a direct influence, say the authors of CPW, on Einstein’s intellectual development.3. A multiplicity of projects pursed with patience & purpose: As Wallace & Gruber say in CPW, “We use the term enterprise to stand for a group of related projects and activities broadly enough defined so that (1) the enterprise may continue when the creative person finds one path blocked, but another open toward the same goal and (2) when success is achieved the enterprise does not come to an end, but generates new tasks and projects that continue it.Enterprises rarely come singly. The creative person differentiates a number of main lines of activity. This has the advantage that when enterprise grinds to a halt, productive work does not cease. The person has an agenda, some measure of control over the rhythm and sequence with which different enterprises are activated. This control can be used to deal with needs for variety, with obstacles encountered…A second outstanding characteristic of enterprises is their longevity and durability. To take only one example, Milton began the work that led to Paradise Lost in 1640, but did not complete it until 1667. It was the major project within the enterprise of writing epic poems; that enterprise was one among several – politics, prose pamphlets, and the shorter poems.”How does pursuing a bunch of projects help creativity? First, these projects give structure to the creative person’s life which might otherwise – to the outsider – look disorganised. Secondly, this range of projects ‘allows the person to choose tasks that fit different moods and needs.’ Thirdly, pursuing a portfolio of projects allows for cross-fertilisation of ideas. For example, “Darwin was a pigeon fancier, but he had no need to strive to be a great breeder. For him, consorting with pigeon breeders was a way of steeping himself in the art and lore of breeding, knowledge that he could turn to good account in other enterprises, in the zone of his greatness.”4. Purposeful repetition & revision: One of the great ironies of creativity is that great works of art or literature that are commonly perceived to be the result of a burst of creativity are usually the result of endless practice, repetition and rehearsal. Take, for example, the poems of William Butler Yeats: “Lest it be thought that liberation from the pressure of will” produced outpourings of untrammeled spontaneity, be it noted that Yeats was an extremely deliberate writer.He “followed a pattern of composition which was to vary very little for the rest of his life: prose draft, rough verse drafts, fair copy, magazine publication and then further revisions for the first printing in book form.” One of his biographers stresses “the tremendous organisation that informs the poems and the poet; every crisis is mastered and every poem comes out of years of preparation.”5. Collaboration & interaction with others: It is extremely rare for creative people to work in a void. Such people have a range of associates around them to provide emotional support (especially encouragement in the face of setbacks), intellectual support (especially thoughts on how to see the same idea differently) and practical help (money, meals, etc). CPW has a riveting chapter on how the English poet, William Wordsworth, wrote his poems and the role that others – particularly his sister, Dorothy, and the poet Coleridge – played in the composition of one of Wordsworth’s most famous poems, ‘The Daffodils’“Wordsworth’s living arrangements facilitated bringing others into the process of reworking [his poems]. This was true of his collaborative relationship with Coleridge and more pervasive and long lived in his relationship with his sister Dorothy.Dorothy was an extremely sensitive observer and recorder of the Lake District’s landscape scenes where she and her brother lived and walked. Wordsworth’s famous poem The Daffodils, composed in 1804, finds its source in the vocabulary and images of Dorothy’s Journal where she describes the daffodils she and her brother had seen on a walk together… Wordsworth’s poem begins:‘I wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o’er vales and hillsWhen all at once I saw a crowd,A host of golden daffodils-Along the lake, beneath the trees,Ten thousand dancing in the breeze…’Dorothy had described the scene in her Journal in April 1802: ‘I never saw daffodils so beautiful they grew upon mossy stones and about them, some rested their heads upon these stones as a on a pillow for weariness and the rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them…’Thus, one of the best known poems in English begins with a joint experience, a scene observed by William and Dorothy…” (Source: Creative People at Work (1989) by Doris Wallace & Howard Gruber)The five bullet points listed above are obviously related. For example, it is difficult for a creative person to pursue repetition & revision if her memory is not highly developed.The causality also flows in the opposite direction: it is not easy to have a highly developed memory if one does not repeatedly practise one’s art. Furthermore, it is difficult to find the motivation for prolonged and repetitive revisions if one does not have an underlying sense of purpose or drive. That, in turn, raises the question why is it that some people are more driven and more motivated than others.Investment implicationsWhen we began building Marcellus a little over a year ago, we consciously looked around not just for the smartest people we knew in the investment profession, but also for people who love to read extensively, to discuss ideas for hours on end and – at the same time - know how to work hard (knowing full well that ‘hard work’ in our profession can come in a multitude of forms ranging from forensic financial analysis to meeting a dozen undergarment dealers in four different cities over two days).In fact, for most of us the very decision to leave behind the world of broking, investment banking and wealth management in order to build Marcellus hinged around such considerations i.e. we wanted to spend lots of time reading and discussing ideas rather than chasing targets, budgets, deadlines and other such ephemera from the conventional business world.We remain keen to work with people who enjoy reading at length and in-depth whilst having the maturity to bounce half-formed ideas off colleagues. We have learnt over time that from the seeds of such protean ideas are great investments born.We seek to work with people whose core purpose in life is purposeful, deep inquiry into companies with the aim of generating healthy returns with compressed levels of risk for our 800 clients. We believe that the reason our two recent books – The Unusual Billionaires (2016) and Coffee Can Investing: The Low Risk Route to Stupendous Wealth (2018) – have become national bestsellers is inherently linked to why our portfolio is delivering decent results i.e. we put our minds together to create a novel construct for investing in a highly conservative manner amidst the chaos of India.

97,1-11-2019,Learning from creative people at work: Purposeful inquiry as core to investing,"Twenty years ago, 12 American academics published a collection of studies tracing the intellectual development of giants like Einstein, Darwin, Faraday, Lavoisier, Beethoven and Wordsworth. This intense study of creative people yields rich learnings. At the core of creativity is a heavy duty memory, a multiplicity of projects, stimulating company and a willingness to work at perfecting your craft for decades on end.“…it is a truism to say that the creative person is unique, since that is true for every human being. But the key point is that the student of creative work makes the understanding of that uniqueness the central goal of the investigation. If there is to be a scientific understanding of creative people, it cannot be limited to those few things we may find common in some creative people. Instead, we must search for a general approach to the description and understanding of unique, creative people.” Doris Wallace & Howard Gruber in ‘Creative People at Work: Twelve Cognitive Case Studies’’ (1989)Learnings from experts’ study of creativityWhatever our abilities might be, British neuroscientist Sarah-Jayne Blakemore has shown that we can improve regardless of our age because of the trainability, the plasticity of the human brain. An especially exciting area of learning is around enhancing our creativity and improving our ability to think originally. American academic Adam Grant’s exceptional book on this subject ‘Originals: How Non-Conformists Change the World’ (2016) has been a rich source of learning for us. We learnt from Grant that “original thinkers – in investing and beyond – have wide-ranging interests beyond their profession, have a yearning to alter the status quo and a high rate of idea generation.”Adam Grant’s book refers to an older, more detailed study of creativity conducted by a dozen American academics in 1989. Creative People at Work: Twelve Cognitive Case Studies is an engrossing study of the greatest minds of the last 500 years. The book traces in detail the education and step-by-step intellectual development of giants like Alfred Einstein, Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, Antoine Lavoisier, Hans Krebs, Beethoven and William Wordsworth. What did they study? For how long? Who were their friends and their sounding boards? How did they juggle multiple projects? How did they deal with setbacks?Both Originals and Creative People at Work say that there is no cut & dried recipe for creativity. Nor is there is a fixed set of personality traits that indicate whether one person will be more or less creative than her neighbour. Both books stress that creativity is the result of purposeful, determined and sustained effort rather than being the result – as the popular preconception goes – of a lightbulb going off in the head of a genius.So what then are the most reliable methods to juice up creativity? Here are our learnings from Creative People at Work (CPW).Five methods to enhance creativity1. Memory: One of the most fascinating aspects of creativity is how dependent it is on memory. Beethoven wrote that “I carry my thoughts about with me for a very long time, often for a very long time before writing them down. I can… be sure that… I shall not forget [a theme] even years later. I change many things, discard others and try again and again until I am satisfied; then in my head I begin to elaborate the work…the underlying idea never deserts me. It rises, it grows. I hear and see the image in front of me from every angle…” (Source: Beethoven: Letters and Journals and Conversations (1952) by M.Hamburger).In our December 10, 2018 blog, we elaborated upon how psychologists have demonstrated that memory is a type of intelligence. In fact, intelligence is nothing more than a specialised bank of memories. In his landmark book Thinking, Fast & Slow’ (2011), Danny Kahneman famously says: “Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find the relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.”That, in turn, leads us to delve into how creative people enhance their memories so that their recall is richer and deeper than that of the average person.Henry Roediger, who runs the Memory Lab at the University of Washington at St Louis, has found that “memory champions” have high cognitive ability. “We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory at all, but of attention”.Simply put, people who have developed their memories to a very high level have highly developed “attentional control”, i.e. the ability to maintain heightened focus on essential information for long periods of time. In other words, a side-effect of the effort that these champions put into memorising stuff is that they learn to concentrate for extended periods of time.This ability can be then usefully applied to any task requiring deep concentration.2. Wide reading alongside deep education: If just reading around widely was all that it took to be creative, then we would have millions of newspaper readers and social media junkies bursting with fresh ideas. Instead, creativity, it would appear, arises from gaining mastery of one’s discipline by using a very specific style of reading/education. We call it the “T-shaped” model of brain development i.e. the creative masters read around extensively while educating/training themselves intensively in a specific field.CPW explains how Albert Einstein used this model of mastery to generate the insight which ultimately led to his “special theory of relativity, a monumental achievement…[for] a single scientist working alone and out of the academic mainstream.”Experts who have sought to understand how Einstein cracked this puzzle have broken his problem-solving into two parts.Step 1 was a thought experiment that Einstein conducted when he was just 16 years old. This thought experiment contained the seeds to cracking the problem of special relativity. In Einstein’s own words from his autobiographical notes, “a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of 16: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity C (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic field at rest, though spatially oscillating. There seems to be no such thing, however, neither on the basis of experience nor according to Maxwell’s equations.From the very beginning, it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the first observer know or be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion?One sees in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained. Einstein’s thought experiment highlighted a paradox with utmost simplicity: either I am moving with the beam of light with velocity C or I am at rest. I cannot be in both states at the same time.Step 2 is Einstein proceeding to crack this paradox over the next 11 years, thus helping the world understand how light travels and more generally, how objects – including celestial bodies – move in a world where gravitational effects are negligible.CPW contends that Einstein’s ability to hit upon the novel thought experiment in Step 1 was greatly helped not just by his (fairly conventional) schooling in Germany and then Italy, but also by: (a) his extensive discussions with his uncle, Caesar Koch, who would spend hours discussing complex maths problems with his teenage nephew; and (b) his special schooling in Switzerland in a Kantonsschule, which specialised in Anschauung i.e. intuition or ‘apprehension or immediate perception that involves fewest elements of rational insight’.Einstein’s success in Step 2 was also underpinned not just by his conventional university education in Zurich Polytechnic, but also the inputs he received on his scientific papers from his uncle.

98,1-11-2019,SBI expects return on assets to hit 4-year high this fiscal,"State Bank of India's return on assets may hit a four-year high this fiscal year on the back of improving interest income, driven by higher net interest margins and stable asset quality, the country’s largest bank told analysts, triggering a surge in its stock on Thursday. In its post results meeting with analysts on Wednesday, the SBI management said it expects the bank’s return on assets (RoA) to improve to 0.4 per cent -0.5 per cent this fiscal and to 0.9 per cent - 1.0 per cent in 2020-21. This would be the highest since 0.4 per cent RoA reported in the year ended March 2016.The rise in RoA would be driven by credit growth of around 10 per cent -12 per cent and higher net interest margins (NIMs) of 3.15 per cent -3.20 per cent , fee income growth of 15 per cent and an estimated slippage ratio of 2 per cent for the year ending March 2020, the management said. It expects the slippage ratio to improve to 1.3 per cent by March 2021.The bank is targeting a pre-provisioning operating profit of ₹65,000 crore this fiscal, which it expects to increase further to ₹75,000 crore in fiscal 2021. In case stress rises, the bank’s pre-provisioning profit could come down to ₹70,000 crore in fiscal 2021, which will depress the RoA at 0.75 per cent -0.85 per cent , it said. That would be still much better than the 0 per cent recorded in fiscal ended March 2019 and negative RoA reported in fiscals 2017 and 2018.“Among PSU banks, SBI remains the best play on the gradual recovery in the Indian economy with a healthy PCR (provision coverage ratio) of 81 per cent , robust capitalisation (Tier 1 of about 11.3 per cent ), a strong liability franchise, and an improvement in core operating profitability,” Motilal Oswal analysts Nitin Aggarwal and Parth Gutka said in a note. SBI shares rose 7.69 per cent to end at ₹312 on Thursday as investors cheered the possibility of improved profitability.However, some analysts are cautious due to uncertainty about the bank’s future asset quality.“We expect good core PPoP (preprovision operating profit) and strong performance from subsidiaries. Valuation is also not expensive…however, we stay equal weight given asset quality uncertainty,” Morgan Stanley Research analysts Sumeet Kariwala and Subramanian Iyer said in a note.“In our view, NPA formation will remain high unless the economy rebounds sharply. Coupled with the continued struggle for banks to recover old bad loans, this implies that credit costs stay high. The other risk with SBI, being the largest state-owned bank, is that it is asked to help stressed borrowers,” their report said.SBI’s net profit for the second quarter ended September increased three times year on year to ₹3,011.73 crore despite the bank using all the gains from stake sale in its life insurance subsidiary for making provisions. The bank’s gross NPAs stood at 7.2 per cent in September, down from 9.95 per cent a year earlier.

102,1-11-2019,View: Chinese transgressions in South China Sea need strong pushback,"By Baladas GhoshalHaiyang Dizhi 8, a Chinese survey vessel that encroached deep into Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) before withdrawing has clearly impinged on the country’s territorial integrity and economic security. Asean, whose one member has been subjected to aggression, must tell China to refrain from such activities. The Haiyang Dizhi 8 vessel first entered Vietnam’s EEZ early July where it began a weekslong seismic survey, triggering a tense standoff between military and coast guard vessels from Vietnam and China. Typically extending up to 200 nautical miles from the coastline, the EEZ allows a country sovereign rights to exploit any natural resources within that area.Last month, a Chinese giant crane vessel had been tracked to 90 km from the Vietnamese coastline fuelling the risk of further maritime confrontation between the two countries. The Lan Jing, believed to be one of the largest crane ships in the world, left the coastal city of Zhanjiang in southern China’s Guangdong province earlier last month. It arrived offshore of Quang Ngai, a province in Vietnam’s south central coast, according to Marine Traffic, a website which tracks vessel movements.The presence of the ship so close to the Vietnamese coastline is an indication of Beijing upping the ante to stretch Hanoi’s maritime capacity to its limit, by hampering Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration which is being carried out in partnership with Russian petroleum company Rosneft. The arrival of the Lan Jing not only had a “political signalling utility” – according to an observer on the issue but also an “operational one” – forcing Vietnam to stretch its limited maritime forces capacity not only in Vanguard Bank but also over Lan Jing. This complicates the situation for Hanoi which already faces a yawning asymmetry with China in terms of maritime forces capacity.Even though Vietnam and China have for years been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of waters and a busy shipping lane in the South China Sea, the latter’s encroachments into Vietnam’s EEZ has intensified in recent years and particularly in the last few months, perhaps to fulfil Emperor Xi Jinping’s dream of Chinese hegemony of the region and to coincide with the celebration of 70 years of the founding of the Communist Republic. China’s unilaterally declared “nine-dash line” marks a vast, U-shaped, expanse of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s continental shelf where it has awarded oil concessions to Russia and India.The Permanent Court of Arbitration Tribunal in 2016 had nullified Chinese claims on practically the whole of South China Sea and its so-called historical rights and nine-dash line, pointing out that Beijing had no entitlement to an exclusive zone within 200 nautical miles of the Spratly Islands. The judgment also indicted Beijing for destroying marine ecology and environment by establishing artificial islands and militarising them for bolstering its claims. The PCA ruling is undoubtedly a victory of a 21st century rules-based order over China’s 19th-century plans for its own sphere of influence. China’s expansive claim on the South China Sea comes at the expense of the legitimate claim of some other countries like the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia to name a few. Its land-grabbing techniques by stealth, artificial island-building and subsequent militarisation to scare others away have reached a dangerous proportion turning South China Sea into a flashpoint that can go out of control any moment.The burden of restraining China and evolving a mechanism to manage conflict in South China Sea falls on Asean. In June, when the Asean foreign ministers met, the chairman’s statement noted concern and weariness about Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea, took note of the land reclamations and activities in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability in the region. In the ongoing Asean Summit in Bangkok, it is imperative that the organisation shows greater unity and insists on Chinese restraint.While India takes a cautious approach on the South China Sea issue, we cannot be indifferent to the increasing tension in the region caused by China’s bellicosity. India must accord South China Sea a higher priority and greater seriousness in foreign policy taking into account geo-economic realities. The South China Sea is a vital waterway through which $5 trillion of trade passes every year. The Straits of Malacca – the choke point which connects the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea – handles five times the volume of oil than the Suez Canal. India’s strategic ties with countries in the region, especially with Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines have become stronger under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Act East Policy.More importantly, the Indo-Pacific is virtually India’s new neighbour. India has as much stake in peace and tranquillity in the South China Sea, as any other regional power – Asean, China, Japan or the US. Asean also likes India to take a more active role in the emerging political, economic and security architecture of Indo-Pacific and it fits in with New Delhi’s own image as an emerging global power. It is therefore expected that PM Modi will touch on the South China Sea in his speeches at the summit and will reiterate India’s position on the freedom of navigation, a rule-based maritime order and settlement of disputes through peaceful means.The writer is a former Professor and Chair in Southeast Asian Studies, JNU"," The article reports that a Chinese survey vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, encroached deep into Vietnam's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) before withdrawing, impinging on the country's territorial integrity and economic security. Asean, which has one member subjected to aggression, must tell China to refrain from such activities. The Haiyang Dizhi 8 vessel first entered Vietnam's EEZ early July where it began a weekslong seismic survey, triggering a tense standoff between military and coast guard vessels from Vietnam and China. Typically extending up to 200 nautical miles from the coastline, the EEZ allows a country sovereign rights to exploit any natural resources within that area.Last month, a Chinese giant crane vessel had been tracked to 90 km from the Vietnamese coastline fuelling the risk of further maritime confrontation between the two countries.

104,1-11-2019,Did Diwali change India's slowdown story? Here's data to help you decide,"Did this sale season dispel some of the gloom that the economy has found itself in during the last several quarters? And if it did, by how much?Latest sales data from automobiles and consumption — the two sectors that have become the face of this slowdown — may provide some insights. These data points may help understand whether or not did Diwali cheers drive away India's consumption blues, and what the post-festival sales numbers really mean.Here is an account of how these two key sectors — one accounts for 60 per cent of India's GDP and the other makes up over half of our total manufacturing output — got stuck in multi-year troughs, and what this Diwali may have changed for them.Let us start with auto, the sector that data shows has shed lakhs of jobs and has gone from being a GDP star to being a drag on growth in a matter of months.Why sales fell the way they didIt all started with the new third-party insurance rule last year which states that if you buy a car after September 1, a portion of your motor insurance premium representing the third-party (TP) liability has to be paid upfront for three years. This means new car buyers now have to shell out more for their motor insurance policies in the first year. For new two-wheeler buyers, the premium for third-party liability of five years will have to be paid upfront.Then came the shadow bank liquidity crunch — probably the single biggest factor in the auto slump. NBFCs dramatically slashed lending in the wake of IL&FS's collapse, affecting the growth of the entire industry.Till that point, NBFCs were helping fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles (both new and used), 30% of passenger cars and nearly 65% of the two-wheelers in India, ICRA data shows. Following the collapse, interest rates for car buyers have gone up in the last 12 months despite the RBI cutting rates, says RC Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki.The impending deadline of mandatory transition to BS-VI from BS-IV emission norms has also proved a hassle for carmakers and car buyers alike. The increased cost associated with this technology change could discourage buyers significantly, analysts say.The continued confusion over the proposed deadline to convert some vehicle categories to electric has not helped either. Electric vehicles are not available/affordable for the Indian buyer yet — they are only accessible to the government or private contractors.Pulling in different directionsWith muted consumer activity in both urban and rural markets, auto industry has had a bumpy ride in the last one year, shows data from SIAM, the apex national body representing all major vehicle and vehicular engine manufacturers in India.According to SIAM, during the past year, the auto sector witnessed falling sales and piling up inventory, with industry leaders like Maruti Suzuki and M&M forced to lay off thousands of workers to deal with the prolonged slump.Passenger vehicles sales in India had hit rock bottom in the year through August on rising prices, scarce loans and a deep demand slump. It was the first time in 10 years that sales fell continuously for an entire year.That was before the festivals. The shopping season did give carmakers some major cheers after a year of gloom — sales rose 5-7% this Navratri, Dussehra and Dhanteras from a year ago. Two-wheelers didn't see much of a festive spike, though sales did improve over previous months.How much does this festive cheer mean to an industry battling an entrenched slump in demand? Analysts are subdued in their enthusiasm. Maruti and Hero MotoCorp — the biggest carmaker and the biggest two-wheeler maker, respectively — themselves maintain that it is too early to take cues from this rise.For the record, both four- and two-wheelers sell double the usual monthly average during the month-long festive in India. In some great years, festive numbers have even gone up 3.5-4 times usual monthly sales.Things were bleak for the auto industry till the onset of the festive season. The industry produced a total 14,427,724 vehicles including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and quadricycle in April-September 2019 as against 16,645,330 in April-September 2018, registering a de-growth (-) 13.32 per cent over the same period last year.One corner of the auto market, however, largely escaped all this mayhem. Lamborghini India announced it was set to post a significant 30% rise in sales in 2019. Mercedes Benz India also over witnessed strong festive demand for its cars, with this year’s festive season deliveries surpassing those from 2018.The top-of-the-line Mercedes SUV, the GLE, is sold out for three months, the company said. The X7, the top SUV from BMW India, was also sold out.From glory to worryFor the ecommerce industry, last year's festive sales had clocked a record 76 per cent year-on-year growth. But sales turned tepid almost immediately after that spike as weak consumer sentiment became more and more entrenched.Matters became more complicated after the government's new FDI rule that debarred online marketplaces from manipulating the price of products or offer deep discounts. As a result of this move, online discounts nearly halved in 2019 compared to the 2018 levels.After the IL&FS debacle, NBFCs and banks were — and still are — less willing to offer consumer loans. It hurt the EMI economy in a major way as premium phones and other large/costly equipment were suddenly out of reach for many consumers.All these factors apparently contributed to a deepening of the weak sentiment as the buyer turned unwilling to purchase discretionary items, sometimes even delaying purchases of staples. Meanwhile, credit became even harder to come by as lenders of all hues, wary after IL&FS, drastically cut down on new loans.The worries of the EMI economy soon seeped into broader consumption numbers. FMCG biggies spoke with one voice how sales were plummeting — or more precisely, how the average Indian consumer was not even buying Rs 5 biscuits.All this indicated etail could be staring at the spectre of a disappointing Diwali when this year's festive sale opened.Consumption slowdown: Myth, busted?With less money in circulation owing to this credit scarcity, what else could India expect but a dire Diwali marked by a consumption slump, right?Not quite. Etailers made a whooping $3 billion (over Rs 21,000 crore) in just the first six days of festive sales this year. Based on this number, the year-on-year growth for etailers, led by Flipkart and Amazon, was 30 per cent, a report by consulting firm RedSeer says.A big chunk of customers this year was from Tier-II cities, the report said. Before the sales began, RedSeer had said there would be a 60% jump in the number of online shoppers from 20 million last year to 32 million this year.For the full festive season, Amazon and Flipkart were expected to make a cumulative $5 billion (Rs 36,000 crore) in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year. Sales eventually missed these targets, but only marginally. According to analysts, this near miss was due to customers' preference for more affordable items, which dragged down the order value, while the number of units sold remained well in line with industry predictions.Brick and mortar retailers also had a strong finish to this festive season, with Diwali sales of smartphones, electronics apparel and consumer products rising about 7-9 per cent.This was a crucial, make-or-break Diwali for these businesses since sales of most categories had fallen or remained flat because of poor consumer sentiment.Brick and mortar businesses and consumer goods companies were fearing the worst this year in both urban and rural India due to a slowing economy over the last three quarters or so. These fears proved unfounded as this year's Diwali and overall festive season sales beat expectations quite handsomely, analysts said.Here is one more data point that may matter. Despite stellar sales by the ecommerce majors, the footfall in malls went up noticeably during the festive period. Does this combined surge of etail & physical retail signal that a consumption recovery has possibly begun? We'll know for sure in a bit."," It seems like the article did not provide any specific information to support its claims about whether or not Diwali cheers drove away India's consumption blues, and what the post-festival sales numbers really mean. However, it is clear that there was a significant increase in online festive sales this year compared to last year, which suggests that consumers are willing to shop online despite the credit crunch. Additionally, brick and mortar retailers also had a strong finish to this festive season, with Diwali sales of smartphones, electronics apparel, and consumer products rising about 7-9 per cent. This was a crucial make-or-break Diwali for these businesses"

109,1-11-2019,Don’t let vested interests stifle innovation: Prosus CEO,"(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: The Indian government should be careful about the intense lobbying by vested interests which are affected by technology disruption and not let them impact new business models and innovation, said Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk. An investment holding company which was recently spun off from South Africa’s Naspers and listed in Amsterdam, Prosus is the biggest technology investor in India after SoftBank with close to $5 billion deployed in the country. It has backed companies like online food delivery player Swiggy and education tech startup Byju’s in India.In an interview to TOI, Dijk said that in some cases, complaints are valid, where there is “unreasonable competition” and everyone should follow rules that are put in place by the government. Dijk said that such moves “in the end do not benefit the customers”, adding that “India has found a good balance and the Modi government is impressive in its judgment” in the past.Dijk’s statement comes at a time when the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) is looking into online food delivery companies like Zomato and Swiggy, where Prosus owns a 39% stake for an investment of $850-900 million, for deep discounting, data masking and private labels.

110,1-11-2019,"Broader market attractive from a 3-5-year perspective: Tushar Pradhan, HSBC Global","There is a need for risk on and given that there is a fair bit of interest globally for assets including emerging markets, India has been a recipient of some flows lately, says Tushar Pradhan, CIO, HSBC Global. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Markets are telling us that the worst of the economic print is behind us. Would you believe the market or would you believe your analysis of macro where the core data is not stabilising and the IIP data is not stabilised. What is the right analogy in this market?The answer is somewhere in between because I do not think the entire market move is due to some expected turn in the economy as such. It is a combination of factors. There is a lot of demand for risk assets all over the world, as the interest rates and yields across the world are coming to zero. There is a need for risk on and given that there is a fair bit of interest globally for assets including emerging markets, India has been a recipient of some flows lately. On top of that, we continue to receive very strong flows in the mutual funds into the Indian equity markets as well.  Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIM LucknowIIML Chief Marketing Officer ProgrammeVisitIIM LucknowIIML Chief Operations Officer ProgrammeVisitIIM LucknowIIML Chief Executive Officer ProgrammeVisitA combination of demand as well as some improvement in sentiment is leading the market to where it is. It remains to be seen whether the economic turnaround is around the corner but clearly, if the early indications of earnings growth has any sign of recovery, that is where the bright spots are, aided by the fact that there will be a much lower tax rate for most Indian corporates going forward. So, there is a combination of factors. There is a little bit of a push from the economic side and a lot of pull from the investors putting money into the asset class and wherever there is demand. Obviously, the price of the asset class does go up a little bit. I would think the answer lies somewhere in between. Going forward, it is going to be difficult for an investor to figure out whether or not to take that jump. Clearly sentiment seems to have shifted and a propensity for risk that has come in as opposed to what we were seeing just a few weeks ago. Where would you look for opportunities to buy in this environment?One has to be cautious in terms of asset allocation. This is clearly not the market to load up in terms of one asset class and one preference. One has to balance the expectation in terms of over what period you are expecting that return. If your period is clearly above five years, equities as an asset class clearly look to be very attractive -- especially the broader markets, not essentially the narrower more visible indexes. The broader market clearly looks very attractive from a 3-5-year perspective. If you look at interest rates, that is a very interesting situation. If you look at the current yields that we are getting, there are clearly much lower than what we expected in India and we see how interest rates have actually gone in the past. You Might Also Like:Over the next 3 years, earnings may grow 15-20%: Manish Gunwani But if we look at inflation and how consistently it has undershot in the last few quarters and if we believe that India structurally is now a lower inflation country than where it was maybe 5-10 years ago, then our interest rate scenario also needs to be adjusted a little bit.  Keep in mind that the real rates in India continue to be one of the highest anywhere in the world, which means that even interest rates here are at risk. That means the bond market as an asset class, over the next two or three years clearly looks a lot attractive even if in the last one year or so, bond funds have probably given between 12% and 15% purely on duration. It is a very interesting time to allocate asseta. I would focus on the fact that the investor needs to decide whether he wants a diversified approach to investing and within equities, the broader market in terms of where the valuation are very attractive, is where I would really look to begin with.  We were having a discussion earlier this morning that one should look at individual stocks or individual sectors that have been bear market survivors. Is that a strategy that you would concur with when it comes to approaching names in the current environment?A lot has changed in the world and one of the biggest investors in the world has looked back and decided that 10 years ago if he was to have invested in companies which have created the biggest market cap today, they did not exist. Whether it is Google or even Apple which existed in a different form that we see it today. So should one look at the current low valuation compared to what these companies used to trade at in the past and try to take a punt?  I would still feel that a diversified approach, keeping a little bit of that in one’s portfolio but looking for new ones and new trends in terms of market cap is likely to be pretty attractively valued in the future. It has to be a mix in terms of the newer companies and one of the more traditional ones weathering all cycles, which also need to be part of the portfolio, but not exclusively. You Might Also Like:Land, labour reforms more important than STT & DDT relief: Saurabh Mukherjea The opportunities are clearly somewhere from now in the next five years. They maybe already in the works or not even there in the markets today. So one should keep an open mind and look at the trends as they develop. One should be very fairly compensated for the kind of risk that you will take right now.  Is the current market level worth a risk in largecap stocks? I am not talking about specific midcaps and beaten down smallcap stocks, but for the largecap stocks, at a time when Nifty and Sensex are touching all time highs, does it make sense to take a risk?I would nuance that question a little bit. I would say that even within the largecaps, there is a concentration of companies which are ever popular and they are clearly trading at valuations which are even higher than their historic highs on an average. So clearly, there is a risk there, though currently the popularity seems to converge there.  The only spanner in that argument is the fact that when you get institutional investors and allocators, they do not go down to stock specific levels. Who can say that these companies may not sustain and not even grow from here? It is very difficult to predict where it is likely to go because demand also is a function of the whole valuation piece and at the top level, if they continue to buy one of the largest, most liquid, most market leading kind of companies, then these companies will continue to not disappoint.  You Might Also Like:Next 18 months belong to India: Sanjiv Bhasin, IIFL SecuritiesBut that is a risky bet. I would think that the risk reward is not in your favour, given the valuation. That does not mean that it is going to be a sell. One has to be very circumspect. We have seen that in the last two years, these companies sustained valuation and continued to remain popular across all portfolios.  They have been expensive two years ago. I think two years is a longish period to not have them and continue to have an underperformance versus having them. It is a difficult question to answer but clearly there is an absolute nature of valuation and some of them are reaching there. Last five years with the exception of an ITC or one or two staples stocks, most of the consumer stocks have given good double digit CAGR returns. Next five years, are we in for no returns or single digit returns or even double digit returns from some of the Nestle, HULs and Colgates of the world?In the very long run, price is a multiple of the profits and the rate of growth in the profits that we look at. The rate of growth in the profits of these companies in the last few years have been much lower than the rate of growth and their stock price. That has led to this multiple expansion as we see. Going forward, two things will emerge -- whether the earnings growth will be much higher which I feel is not likely or whether the popularity continues to remain there. In this case, if it sustains the multiple, you are going to make no return or may be flat return over the next few periods.  If you feel that the rest of the economy continues to suffer and we are looking at a very prolonged period of a slowdown in the economy, then they will continue to outperform relatively, even if they do not give you an absolute return. It is a portfolio allocation issue. They are clearly overvalued but as a portfolio strategy, they may form part of a portfolio given your view in terms of where the next few months or the next few years are likely to be. If you think that we are in a period of pretty significant economic growth and that the broader economy will sustain and improve, then clearly they needed to be underweight. But if you think that it is likely to remain for a much longer period, then they need to be a significant part of your portfolio. That would be one way to look at it. Currently everyone is focussing on them with the divestment agenda being top of mind. Of course, we have also seen a fantastic move in some of the key names like BPCL, SCI and Concor, that perhaps are slated to be put on the block. Also, what are you making of the rally that we have been seeing on some of these PSU names?There is a lot of value there. I do not think anybody disagrees about the value but the thing is how would it be realised? What is the kind of monetisation that one gets out of the value? Is it going to be by way of a complete privatisation or is there autonomy?  Some of the PSUs have a quasi monopoly in the markets that they operate in and given over to a much more autonomous management and given the monopoly, these companies are worth a lot of money. But if the monopoly goes away, the implicit support which is there as part of the government owned company goes away and if they have to standalone on their own given the fact that some of these prices at which they sell and the commodities that they deal in are also mandated by the government. It is not a very clear picture.  It is easy to say that they are cheap and they will definitely get a rerating, but whether all of that rerating is captured and what kind of company will this be 5-10 years from now, remains to be seen in terms of what you know in terms of of autonomy, government regulations and what sort of freedom does the market let these companies operate in?  The spectrum of the PSUs is also very wide. There are companies in the petroleum sector, companies in gas, banking sector so on so forth so difficult question to answer right now but yes there is clearly value comparable to some of the like companies abroad where these companies command a little bit of a premium than what they are trading right now here in India. All of us have in a sense been fooled a couple of times in the last two or three years on prospects of an earnings recovery. This year everything has gone wrong. When do you think the the real capex/the corporate recovery will happen?Corporate recovery is clearly being helped by the corporate tax cut. Reported earnings clearly will be on a much safer trajectory in the next one year at least. What remains to be seen is whether that translates into a much broader economic move which again leads to corporate profits being strong and robust for the next couple of years.  There have been moves in the external context which also has had an impact on companies which are exposed to these markets. Every quarter, there is one thing or the other which puts things off and that is because of a lack of concerted economic turnaround. We have seen patches of growth within the economy and some companies do well and some companies do not do well. But all that we need is for these earnings growth recoveries to happen and sustain in order to have a complete turnaround which has to cross the broader market and be across all sectors. That is when we can say that earnings recovery is here to stay. Otherwise, it is going to be pretty stock specific, and at times even sector specific. This is likely to continue and these cancelations will on an aggregate tell you again that earnings have been flat.  But for some companies, profit growth has been pretty significant and in double digits. For Some companies, profit growth has been flat to negative. When you put that all as an average, we tend to jump to the conclusion that the earnings have been flat which they have on an average, but the economic recovery has not been very uniform and that is what we are waiting for. What is the outlook when it comes to the liquidity situation? While we have seen a pickup attributed to the corporate tax rate cut, the kind of environment that we are seeing right now with earnings being better than expected, global flows being supportive as well, how do you see the trend in terms of liquidity from foreign flows shaping up?Clearly, there is a risk on. The yields that most of the foreign investors are looking at in their domestic economies are very, very low. There does not seem to be any hope of inflation again returning to these economies. There continues to be a very difficult growth scenario especially in Europe as we see.  So given all of that where does one allocate assets, clearly the emerging markets are also struggling, it is not as if there are bright spots either. But given the demographics, given the potential for growth in emerging markets, clearly some of that capital will get attracted into these assets. In a sense, liquidity is pretty much out there and there does not seem to be any quantitative easing. The quantitative tightening was there for a very short period and we are not seeing any economy, any central bank signalling that we will take liquidity back out. So, liquidity will sustain. It will continue to remain adequate at least for the foreseeable future.You Might Also Like:Domestic investors are flush with money and a lot of it is going into equities: Sunil Subramaniam, Sundaram MFConnect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy",ERROR: The prompt size exceeds the context window size and cannot be processed.

112,1-11-2019,"No GST on adoption fees, kids not goods: AAR","(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 01, 2019)MUMBAI: The fees that prospective parents pay to adopt a child is not subject to Goods and Services Tax, the Maharashtra bench of the Authority for Advance Rulings has said. AAR gave the ruling after agreeing with the argument of a recognised adoption agency from Nerul that children are not “goods” and the agency does not provide any “services” to the prospective parents.Indian couples interested in adopting a child must pay a fee of Rs 40,000. Those living abroad and wishing to adopt from India are charged $5,000. The fees are set by the government under the ‘Adoption Regulations’, and specialized (recognized) adoption agencies are permitted to receive payment directly from the prospective parents and use it for the welfare of the kids with them.The AAR ruling came on a plea filed by the Nerul charitable trust that the fees it receives should not be subject to GST. Children of the World India Trust said it houses 44 kids, of whom 22 are below 3 and the rest under 6. Some of them are special needs kids, it said.Children of the World submitted before AAR that some of the special needs children with it needed care like physiotherapy and occupational therapy. The agency further contended that from the time a child is admitted to its Vishwa Balak Kendra—child shelter unit—the trust provides for his/her food, clothing, shelter, foster care, health care, schooling, etc until the time the child is adopted or transferred to another government organisation. The trust has around 20 lady caretakers and nine nursing staff to look after the infants round the clock. During the course of the hearing before AAR, it produced pictures of children being cared for, being taught alphabets, etc, to support its claims.Contending that children are not “goods”, the trust pointed out that it does not make any “supply” in the “furtherance of business”, which is an integral element for imposition of GST. It said it is a registered charitable trust whose activities are exempted from GST. It added that it is regulated by the government through the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) and has no control over the admission of a child in its kendra or selection of children by prospective parents.Submitting before the AAR bench that it is not engaged in any business, the trust pointed out that adoption of a child cannot be a business in view of the strict provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. In fact, if there is any element of business in adoption activities, it will be treated as a criminal offence, it said.Taking cognizance of the submissions, AAR held that the activities conduct by the trust were charitable and hence exempted from GST. Further, it said, the receipt of adoption fees would be exempt from levy of GST."," The article reports on a ruling made by the Maharashtra Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) which stated that children are not ""goods"" and that a recognized adoption agency from Nerul does not provide any ""services"" to prospective parents.

116,1-11-2019,"UN must uphold rights of all persons with disabilities: Gopinathan Achamkulangare, former Indian diplomat","New Delhi: Gopinathan Achamkulangare, former Indian diplomat and currently Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations System has urged that a perspective relating to the inclusion of persons with disabilities and their rights, particularly as it relates to accessibility, be incorporated into all facets of the work of the United Nations system organisations. In a recent interview with UN Chronicle Gopinathan spoke on the current state of accessibility within the United Nations system and the prospects for addressing the situation comprehensively.How does the United Nations define “disability”? What percentage of the world’s people live with a disability?The most authentic definition of “disability” in the United Nations is provided by preambular paragraph (e) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which states that “Disability is an evolving concept that results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and active participation in society on an equal basis with others”.According to the World Health Survey, a World Health Organization-World Bank study implemented from 2002 to 2004, about 15 per cent of the world’s population is estimated to live with some form of disability.For the purposes of the JIU review, we used these two markers.The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted by the General Assembly in December 2006, and today, 92 States or groups of States are parties to the Convention. How does the Convention protect the rights and improve the lives of persons with disabilities? What does article 9 cover, and how is it currently applied within the United Nations system?The Convention has been path-breaking in that it is the first-ever legal instrument that confers on persons with disabilities enforceable rights; it goes beyond measures for their well-being and welfare, and recognizes their non-derogable rights to their participation on an equal footing. The related treaty body—the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities—reviews the periodic reports submitted by the States parties to the Convention on their compliance with the provisions of the Convention, providing details about how they have been fulfilling their obligations under the Convention. Assuming that States parties are making determined efforts to do so, the situation of persons with disabilities is bound to witness significant improvements in the coming years.The Convention recognizes the imperative of enhancing accessibility and devotes one whole article (article 9) to this aspect; it is often described as the “backbone” of the Convention. Central to its framework is application of the concept of the universal design, which makes society accessible for all human beings, not only for persons with disabilities—hence the mantra “essential for some, useful for all”. It goes without saying that the related provisions apply equally to the organizations of the United Nations system, and it is incumbent upon them to develop, promulgate and implement minimum standards and guidelines for the accessibility of facilities and services to those who interact with the United Nations organizations. The recent JIU report addresses the issue of enhancing accessibility to United Nations system conferences and meetings for persons with disabilities. What are some of the key findings of this report?The five key findings from the report are as follows:(a) Formal policies on accessibility are lacking in most organizations but can be developed through utilization of existing guidance documents.(b) In headquarters locations, most organizations are not providing many essential services to make meetings more accessible. Field office accessibility lags even further behind. For meetings at off-site locations, most organizations neither adequately monitor accessibility provisions, nor set minimum accessibility requirements.(c) Persons with disabilities and their representative organizations expressed a low level of satisfaction with existing accessibility provisions and outlined a series of corrective measures.(d) Various other deficits were identified in relation to internal capacity, coordination, knowledge-sharing and accountability on accessibility matters; these have a negative impact on the participation of persons with disabilities.(e) Overall, progress towards mainstreaming accessibility as a cross-cutting issue in the work of organizations has been limited.The JIU review indicated that there are no international standards on accessibility that are accepted and used system-wide in the United Nations. What are some good-practice elements in existing policies in certain United Nations agencies and entities that others can take into consideration when developing their own policies?The JIU review has two annexes that provide useful information in this respect. Annex I provides a list of guidance documents that cover specific realms of accessibility, such as the Accessibility Guidelines for the United Nations Websites, and those for accessible meetings and accessible publishing; Ask It Right: A Guide for Interviewing People with Disabilities (on courtesy, etiquette and sensitiveness); Promoting Diversity and Inclusion Through Workplace Adjustments: a Practical Guide; and the Telecommunications Accessibility Checklist. Annex II provides a non-exhaustive list of international standards for accessibility, most of which are from the International Telecommunication Union and the International Organization for Standardization.It is pertinent to mention in this context the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights policy entitled “United Nations Human Rights Reasonable Accommodation Policy” (2018), which includes important accountability provisions whereby event organizers are required to evaluate the implementation of the accommodation requested and provide clear justifications for denial. The policy includes provision for redress through which a person who is denied reasonable accommodation can contest the decision before the organizational leadership. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific has developed very useful operational guides for disability inclusive meetings that should serve as useful referral documents for other agencies.I would also like to recall here the contents of Chapter III of the report, which speaks of the desirability of having system-wide standards for accessibility.Does the United Nations provide funding for United Nations system organizations to improve access for persons with disabilities?I should like to answer this question on two levels. First, funding and costs often become excuses for inaction; we encountered this several times while working on the review. At the same time, many entities have developed creative solutions within existing resources. As we point out in the report, the problem most often is lack of awareness, which is pervasive, rather than costs.This is not to say that costs and funding do not matter. The report speaks of how an entity has already embarked on an ambitious plan to identify the accessibility deficits and divide them into three categories—short term, medium term and long term. Broadly, the first would be addressed within existing resources (scrounging on the amounts for repairs and maintenance, for example, as many have done); the second by seeking funding from potential donors; and the third by speaking with host country authorities for permissions and funding. In general, the United Nations Secretariat, the United Nations Funds and Programmes and the Specialized Agencies are individually responsible for accessibility improvement for the offices that fall within their respective remit of authority. Only in cases where various organizations share common premises—such as One UN Houses in field locations—do they share costs for accessibility improvements.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is designed to “leave no one behind”. How inclusive is the Agenda with regard to persons with disabilities?The Sustainable Development Goals reference disability in seven targets across five goals, while another six goals have targets linked to disability-inclusive development. Consequently, there does not appear to be any problem with the legislative mandate; the challenge is one of implementation and operationalization. Additional factors include the lack of awareness and that of internal coordination.How has the participation of persons with disabilities in international deliberative processes been hampered in the past? Why is it important to include their perspectives?A person who has never sat in a wheelchair should hardly be able to tell those who are confined to a wheelchair for life how to address their inclusion. That is where consultation with those affected becomes imperative.What is meant by “nothing about us without us”?This symbolizes the obligation of the society to consult the persons with disabilities at every step of the way; it is the most practical manifestation of disability inclusion. Any measure should proactively consult those affected and incorporate their viewpoints and suggestions, aside from the obligations assumed under the Convention.There are 10 major recommendations put forward in the report. Can you describe one or two key recommendations and how they might improve access throughout the United Nations system?It would not be prudent to pick and choose recommendations as they address key aspects of accessibility that are mutually reinforcing. There is only one recommendation addressed to the legislative organs and governing bodies, which is for them to include in their agenda the review of periodic reports submitted on measures to enhance accessibility. Other recommendations are addressed to executive heads and call upon them to, among other measures, develop a draft policy on accessibility, appoint an accessibility focal point, provide options for remote participation in all meetings and conferences, and stipulate accessibility requirements for all conferences and meetings hosted offsite.From your perspective, what would be the most favorable outcome of the upcoming deliberations on this issue?I pray and hope for a resolution by the General Assembly endorsing the recommendations and asking for their implementation system-wide. However, given our experience over the last five to six years of how JIU reports are dealt with in deliberations, even those reports that have been welcomed widely by the participating organizations, I am afraid that my optimism may be misplaced, unless at least some of the more proactive Member State delegations get together and work diligently towards such an outcome.If you would allow me a personal note, this has been the most rewarding and satisfying review that I have done in my seven years in the Joint Inspection Unit.", Thank you for your response. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

120,1-11-2019,Draft education policy may let kids take boards twice a year,"(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 01, 2019)NEW DELHI: If the final draft of the new National Education Policy is approved, a candidate may be able to take the board exams twice in a year as early as 2022, thereby eliminating the “high stakes” aspect of the exams and easing the pressure on students and their parents. Allowing students to excel in topics of their choice, the straitjacket of a particular format of subjects could also be relaxed and students will be able to pick subjects depending on their individualised interests for the board examinations.Moreover, the new policy also calls for a high-quality common modular entrance exam multiple times each year for undergraduate admissions in higher education institutions.Under school education and in the sub-section “Transforming assessment for student development”, the NEP says the “schooling system will shift from one that primarily tests rote memorisation skills to one that is more formative, is competency based, promotes learning and development for our students, and tests higher-order skills such as analysis, critical thinking, and conceptual clarity.”In order to reverse the “harmful effects” of the current assessment system, the NEP is of the view that the board exams will test primarily core capacities, so that “any student who has been going to and making a basic effort in a school class will be able to pass the corresponding subject board exam without much additional effort.”  The policy draft has entrusted the task of preparing the guidelines for multiple board exams on the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for the transformation of the assessment system by 2022.According to former CBSE chairperson Ashok Kumar Ganguly, “What the new policy is talking about is semesterisation of board exam. The core curriculum approach is now being done away with. The board exam will now be modular in nature and students will be given options to take board exams twice in a given single year. As the number of variables in our board exam is very large, how this will be implemented in very large boards like UP and CBSE needs to be seen. And whether this will not adversely impact the already precarious teaching learning process in the school.”Welcoming the focus on formative assessment, Ganguly however said that there is also not much clarity about exam pattern in class IX and XII. “It is heartening that policy recognises the importance of formative assessment but how this will be given effect at grassroot level needs to be seen – knowing the fact that continuous and comprehensive evaluation earlier were discarded.”Another former CBSE chief B P Khandelwal said board exams had already seen a transformation when they used to be conducted for two-years of study (Class XI and XII). “Now the board exam is based only on class XII syllabi. The point the policy is clear about is that one should not create trauma in the minds of the students due to board exams. The competition in board exam has become nothing but attainment of high marks and not quality assessment. Last decade or so we have seen how marks have been inflated. “Linking the transition from school to higher education, the NEP states that the principles for university entrance exams will be similar whereby the NTA will deliver high-quality common modular entrance exams multiple times annually in various subjects and the exams shall test the conceptual understanding and the abilities to apply knowledge, and shall eliminate the need for taking coaching for these exams.“It is good that university entrance exams are now being taken care of for the first time. It was long due. That the process of university entrance exam is being changed from a system of elimination to a system of selection is a welcome step,” said Ganguly while registering his concern that the quality of university education across the country is not uniform."," The article discusses the proposed changes to the board exams in India under the new National Education Policy. It suggests that the final draft of the policy allows students to take the board exams twice in a year, starting from the academic year 2022-23. This change is aimed at reducing stress and pressure on students and their parents. The article also highlights the benefits of semesterization of board exam and the relaxation of the straitjacket of a particular format of subjects for undergraduate admissions in higher education institutions. Additionally, it mentions that the new policy entrusts the task of preparing guidelines for multiple board exams to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) by 2022. However, the article also expresses concern about the lack of clarity on exam pattern in class IX and XII and the competition in board exams becoming only about attaining high marks rather than quality assessment."

Core sector has a 40% weightage in the broader index of industrial production, which may now slump further from a 1.1% contraction in August, its worst performance in over seven years.While the business confidence was gloomy, de Lima said that the impending lowering of commercial lending rates could potentially revive private consumption and help to shift growth higher as the year ends. The Reserve Bank of India, which has already cut the key repo rate by 1.35 percentage points in the current year, is expected to reduce rates again in December.Goods producers may then be encouraged to resume investments and create jobs, which combined with cuts to corporate taxes could bode well for the outlook, as per the report."," The article reports that India's manufacturing activity declined to a two-year low in October due to slower growth in new orders and output, making business confidence slip to its lowest level in over two-and-a-half years according to a private survey.

The Assembly constituency is about 60 km from Bengaluru.The Cabinet, which met here on Thursday, sought to put at rest speculations over the location of the proposed college by deciding it in favour of Chikkaballapur. The district headquarters was represented in the Assembly by Dr K Sudhakar, who is among the 17 lawmakers who resigned in July paving the way for the collpase of the JD(S)-Congress regime and formation of the BJP government.Earlier this week, Shivakumar, a former minister, had said that he would lay down his life to retain the college.

This might actually go down as the next set of estimates come up, says Dr Abhijit Sen, Professor, JNU. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Monsoons have been abundant and extended, but may be too much. Do you think long monsoon will have an impact on crops and then inflation?Yes, this year’s monsoon has been extremely abnormal. The total monsoon is extremely good but the pattern is not just weird, but on balance bad for crops. We do have the first advance estimate on kharif production from the ministry. Now that shows not much change from last year; rice up a little bit, other cereals down a little bit. Cereals on the whole about the same as last year; pulses down by about 10%; oilseeds up very marginally and cotton and sugarcane down significantly.  Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIM LucknowIIML Chief Operations Officer ProgrammeVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Digital OfficerVisitIIM KozhikodeIIMK Chief Product Officer ProgrammeVisitSo roughly the forecast at the moment from the official sector is that this year’s output will be a little bit less than last year’s for these major crops. This might actually go down as the next set of estimates come up for the reasons that there is likely to be an impact on harvested yields and these figures that the government is putting out at the moment, depend mainly on the area sown.  There might be some downward revisions but I do not think it is going to be remarkably less than last year except in certain crops where the late rainfall would have affected harvesting and for certain fruits and vegetables where not just the harvesting, it would have an effect on the logistics as well. So broadly, it is a good average monsoon accompanied by at best average and almost certainly, below average output. So that is the story. What would be the effect on inflation is difficult to say because that depends as much on demand. However, given this outcome, we will have to wait till rabi for the agricultural sector to give any demand impetus to the economy. What happens to prices would depend upon what is happening to demand in the rest of the economy which at the moment does not look all that great.You Might Also Like:Strong monsoon isn't always good news for farmers As for how the government is able to manage and implement its minimum support price systems which too is going to be under tremendous pressure because stocks are extremely high. You have said it will depend on demand but what is your sense in terms of the spending power of the rural economy? Do you see it bouncing back soon? We have just come out of the festive season and trends otherwise have been encouraging. I do not know what you mean by saying trends have been encouraging! Yes, the stock market looks good but open today’s paper and you have got a 5% decline in the core sector in IIP, Cognizant is laying off huge number of workers. All these are in the front page along with the stock market doing well.  The point is that if the stock market is picking up something which is not a part of the indices of production either agriculture or industry and is well above what is going on even in say the IT sector, that would have an effect, obviously. I am not sure what is being factored in to get that effect.  As far as the agricultural sector is concerned, I think, forget any real bounce in kharif, the bounce if it comes, is very likely to come in rabi crop. That is simply because although the high rainfall has not been that great for the kharif crop, it is going to keep the reservoirs full and that will be good for rabi. If you want a bounce, wait till May. You Might Also Like:Monsoon begins retreat from India after an extended stay You are saying that as of now it is okay when it comes to crops, the inflation picture is on the lower side and as of now the rural economy is not really going anywhere.That is right. What would be that silver lining? What would be needed apart from the overall rainfall factor?At the moment, even more than output. it is the price realisation of farmers that matters. Farm spending, farm business confidence, farmers outlook depend on what the future looks like and it has to do with one simple thing -- if they are going to get a decent price for the crop they grow? Nothing has changed on that.  This year, when rainfall was bad, some people were expecting a very good output. But the rainfall came along at the wrong time and they are going to lose it. You are going to have a lot of people very distressed and to get out of that distress, we need a very good crop and good prices.  As I said, I can see some of that for rabi but that is one season on. It starts coming in from April and you will see the full effects only in May. But even then the market has to give the farmer a good price. It all depends on the overall demand situation in the economy and the demand situation for the farm sector. You Might Also Like:Food grain output seen at 140.57 million tonne in FY20 on monsoon boost Now on that side, monsoon might deliver higher output but it is not going to deliver demand and I cannot quite see where the extra demand is going to come from to keep up farm prices. On the other hand, a lot of people are sitting back and saying that agricultural output will go back up you will have a boost coming from the agricultural sector, from the rural sector. It is not just a chicken and egg problem, it just does not add up. We can talk about crop prices, we can talk about monsoon but somewhere if the real estate prices in India or the land prices in India do not recover, will the rural economy remain under stress? Is that a big trend which we need to monitor?A lot of these prices that you are talking about -- land, real estate -- are things where people in the market are making decisions looking ahead. These are not things you are doing just for today. These are things where we have built in an outlook of the buyer and the seller; about what is likely to happen tomorrow. That is the nature of any investment real estate or things like that and that requires that confidence to return in the economy. This is a relatively slow growing phenomenon and it is a fairly good indication of animal spirits. You need to have something which is outside the normal to jolt back those animal spirits. The only thing we have so far is the corporate tax cut and that is not going to do much for the real estate sector.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","That's a great summary of the article!

After plunging to a two-decade low last year, exports may not fare better in the current fiscal, they said. “The recession seen in many countries in the past couple of years is yet to get over. Demand has slowed from all key markets such as the US, Europe and West Asia,’’ said DV Kamath, managing partner at Mangaluru-based Mangala Cashew Industries.Higher global demand and competitive domestic prices led to a 12 per cent increase year-on-year in cashew exports in April-August to 27,144 tonnes, even as there was a 9 per cent decline in value to ₹1,545 crore since the unit price had dropped.Indian cashew exporters were able to compete effectively with Vietnam, the largest exporter of the nut. Local sales fetched cashew processors ₹700 per kg compared with export earning of less than ₹600 per kg. “Domestic prices may drop to around ₹600 after Diwali but it will be still better than the export price, which will also fall,’’ said Kamath.Exports got a fillip came after the government fixed the minimum import price for broken and whole cashew kernels in June to curb increasing imports. “That helped push shipments. Good demand in the local market helped exporters subsidise exports,’’ said S Kannan, executive director, Cashew Export Promotion Council of India.

149,1-11-2019,How the Indian telecom industry is heading towards a duopoly,"By P R Sanjai and Ragini SaxenaWhen Arun Sarin, Vodafone Group Plc’s India-born former CEO, was charting the British telecommunications firm’s expansion into emerging markets in the mid-2000s, his home country with more than a billion potential phone users seemed a compelling choice.Sarin wasn’t alone. Norway’s Telenor ASA, Russia’s Mobile TeleSystems PJSC and Malaysia’s Maxis Bhd were also among a slew of companies that flocked to this fast-growing market. The carriers banded with local partners, bid for airwaves and licenses, spending billions of dollars to prepare their networks.But what once appeared to be their most-promising Asian wireless market has turned sour. Vodafone’s Indian venture with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, saddled with $14 billion of debt, is said to be seeking to revamp its borrowings amid mounting losses and a tariff war. Tycoon Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. is rated junk by Moody’s Investors Service. In a market that had a dozen carriers two years ago, just three are left standing today - two of them, barely.High fees, frequent policy flip-flops, endless tax demands from an unsympathetic bureaucracy that treated carriers as cash cows have driven most of the operators aground. The industry has become the latest cautionary tale for investors in India, showing why despite moving up the global rankings for ease of business, the burgeoning $2.7 trillion economy with a massive consumer base remains a tough, unpredictable place for those who still dare.The latest blow to the survivors came last week. The nation’s Supreme Court, ruling on a years-long dispute, ordered several carriers to pay the government an additional $13 billion in past fees. The British firm’s venture, Vodafone Idea Ltd., faces a bill of $4 billion, a burden that could sink the company.  India’s putting its mobile-phone miracle in peril: Mihir Sharma“The government is becoming greedy and extracting the maximum from them,” said Mohan Guruswamy, a former finance ministry official and now chairman of the Centre for Policy Alternatives in New Delhi. “The whole sector is in the doldrums. This judgment will effectively destroy Vodafone Idea, and what you’ll have is an emerging duopoly.”When India announced its New Telecom Policy in 1999, it said the industry was of “vital importance” with “widespread ramifications on the entire economy,” and vowed to create an “enabling framework for the development” of telecommunications.Record rakingWhile that worked in theory, policy makers also realized that the auction of airwaves and sale of licenses could fetch billions of dollars, a revenue source key to narrowing the government’s budget deficit. For instance, in a 2015 auction, India raised a record $18 billion, after getting almost $10 billion in the previous year. But in 2012, a plan to collect as much as 400 billion rupees ($7.3 billion at the then exchange rate) flopped as bidders balked, prompting it to cut prices later.Spectrum costs in India are among the highest in the world, according to data compiled by Analysys Mason Spectrum Tracker. The leading telecom operators in India pay the largest share of their aggregate revenue for airwaves at 7.6%, followed by Thailand at 7.3% and Bangladesh at 7%, according to Moody’s Investors Service.Driving up costsWhile the government set high prices, the carriers had themselves to blame too. Competition drove the operators to outbid each other at spectrum auctions, driving up their costs.As a result, companies took on billions of dollars in debt to stay in the game even as competition among a dozen operators for a slice of the market drove down tariffs to less than a cent, weighing on their earnings. Then came Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. in 2016, offering free calls and cheap data on its 4G network, backed by the deep pockets of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s oil-to-petrochemicals empire.Jio’s entry shook up the industry that was already hobbling.In the past two years, two of India’s larger telecom operators - Malaysian tycoon T. Ananda Krishnan’s Aircel Ltd., and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. - went into bankruptcy. Vodafone’s India unit announced its merger with Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd. in 2017 to take on Jio, but it has reported losses every quarter since.“The Indian telecom market had three major challenges,” said Sanjay Kapoor, former CEO of Bharti Airtel’s India and South Asia operations and now a director on the board of Saudi Telecom Co. “Intense competition, high cost structure with exorbitant spectrum prices coupled with government charges and lowest average revenue per user.”But there were other equally daunting hurdles too. Some examples of policy flip-flops here:Tax demand When Vodafone entered India by acquiring Hutchison Whampoa’s Indian operations in 2007, the government slapped the buyer with a tax bill of $2.2 billion. Vodafone disputed the tax and India’s Supreme Court agreed that no law upheld the levy of the tax. But the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee amended the tax rules retrospectively, and the carrier is still fighting the demand.License cancellations In 2008, the government allocated 2G airwaves and licenses without auction. The Comptroller and Auditor General in 2010 said that method caused a presumptive loss to the government. Two years later, the Supreme Court canceled 122 mobile-phone permits won by companies including Etisalat DB, Sistema and Telenor.A decade after its struggle in India, Newbury, England-based Vodafone Group has one foot out the door. CEO Nick Read said in September that the company isn’t keen to plow any more money into the local venture, in which Vodafone holds about 44%. A Vodafone Group spokesman declined to comment for this story, while Idea said Thursday that it isn’t aware if its British partner is looking to exit India.Former Vodafone CEO Sarin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.Warned lendersVodafone Idea has approached creditors for better terms, including a temporary halt to payments, and has warned lenders it won’t be able to honor its commitments for long under current conditions, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The company denied making such a move, but said “all telecom operators have asked for requisite help in reducing” the financial stress. Shares of Vodafone Idea have tumbled 83% this year following a 65% slump in 2018.Following the Supreme Court ruling on the extra fees, Bharti Airtel deferred its quarterly earnings announcement by two weeks to Nov. 14. Fitch Ratings said Oct. 30 that it’s placed Bharti on negative watch at BBB-, the lowest investment grade.The court order is the “last straw,” the Cellular Operators Association of India said last week, while Bharti and Vodafone Idea urged the government to address their concerns and mitigate their financial stress.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government said this week that it is considering some relief measures. A panel of senior bureaucrats will look into steps including deferment of airwaves payments that are due by March 2021 and 2022.“The government on its end is in a difficult position where if it lets Vodafone Idea fail, it will lead to a duopoly, which is not the healthiest market structure for any country,” said Rohan Dhamija, head of South Asia and Middle East at Analysys Mason. “We, hence, feel that the government might step in with subtle help for the sector.”"," By P R Sanjai and Ragini Saxena

156,1-11-2019,"Commercial real estate may do better in 2019 compared to last year: Anuj Puri, Anarock Property","On the residential side, affordable is doing well but do not think that just because it is affordable, anything goes. If the design is not right, it will not sell. Corporate developers are doing well but the guys who are less disciplined and have too much debt exposure, are struggling, says Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Can you walk us through the impact of the slowdown on the real estate sector as a whole? What are the current demand trends?I would divide it into two parts – one is the commercial and the other one is the residential. The commercial is doing exceptionally well. CY2018 was one of the best years. I think 2019 will surpass 2018. Rental continues to grow between 1% and 3% every year. US corporates continue to outsource more and more to India and hence the demand for the commercial space. We have seen private equity investing into this sector even more in the first half of 2019. The REITs Embassy has listed it.  Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIM LucknowIIML Chief Operations Officer ProgrammeVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Digital OfficerVisitIIM KozhikodeIIMK Chief Product Officer ProgrammeVisitI am hoping in the next two or three months, there will be others who will come and list their respective portfolios on the REIT and that part of the market is going very strong, very stable and will continue to remain solid. The trouble is in the residential segment, If we divide this segment into two parts -- the affordable and the mid housing luxury premium. The affordable housing is doing very well. There is no problem. In the last 8-10 days, we have launched some of the schemes and we have seen 700-800 apartments being sold in seven-eight days. For the right developer, right ticket price and right location, there is a huge demand.  The one caveat that I will put on the affordable housing is that many developers think it is only about the price. They are going to be mistaken. It is also about the design. While there is a lot of hot selling affordable housing, there is an equally unsold inventory on affordable housing and that is because these designs are improper. They do not have the right ventilation or the lighting and they are inhabitable. So developers thinking that it is only a price game, are mistaken.  The guy going for affordable housing still has an aspiration and wants a better quality living. So one cannot say this is only about money and this is what people are going to get for a lower sum. The B part is on the mid-housing premium luxury. There, developers like Mr Joshi and others are doing very well. They are launching their schemes. They are selling because they have the right corporate governance, financial discipline, delivery, focus on the customer and right design. They are doing well. You Might Also Like:Indian real estate attracts Rs 39,182 cr PE investments in first 3 quarters of 2019 The larger problem is that majority of the developers have really huge amount of debt and issues on corporate governance and financial indiscipline. Much of the money that came in was taken away from the project for other things and that is where they are really struggling. So just to summarise, commercial segment is doing very well. That market has also got consolidated. There are no more than three or four dozen developers across India who do commercial projects.  On the residential side, affordable is doing well but do not think that just because it is affordable, anything goes. If the design is not right, it will not sell. The B part where the problem is that the corporate developers are doing well but the guys who are less disciplined and have too much debt exposure, are struggling and that is a large portion of the developer community. I see ghost buildings all around in Mumbai. Towers have been constructed and are getting constructed, but there is no demand. and yet construction is happening.Yes, absolutely correct. What you are saying is largely true in central and south Mumbai. You are right in asking why are the buildings still getting constructed? These are mistakes of good times. These buildings had started in 2011-2012 and because these are high rise buildings, it is taking seven, nine years for these buildings to get completed. In the interim ,period the market has changed and moved away from premium luxury to more mid level affordable housing segment. But the developer could not have left the building incomplete. They had debt pressure; lenders were putting pressure on developers to t least complete the building. Once it is completed, there is hopefully light at the end of the tunnel and that is the reason why you are seeing all these buildings getting completed and delivered while there is very little occupancy in the neighbourhood. But ultimately I agree with the developer, I agree with the lender that the mistake had been made but they had to deliver it. If you did not deliver, you were going out of the match even without playing one ball. At least stay on the pitch and you would hopefully get a chance to defend yourself and emerge as a winner. That is why all these buildings are getting completed. You Might Also Like:PE investments in real estate up 19% to USD 3.8 billion in Jan-Sept: Anarock The second question you may ask is then why are they not bringing down the price and why are they not doing a firesell so that they are able to immediately start the habitation within that vicinity. They have very little leverage left.  At the price that they are currently selling, they are barely able to cover the debt that they have on the building. I think most of these buildings equity is really wiped off. Now either the NBFC or the bank has to take a call that they are willing to take a hit and hence willing to bring down the price or they will have to very slowly come out of this situation. In conclusion, I will say is that it is a mistake of good times but they have to be delivered. The buildings which started in 2011-2012, are getting completed in 2019-2021.  I am hoping that at some stage, the lenders may take a call and say we will need to bring down the price. We may need to take a haircut but ultimately we need to sell these units and bring in the pace and momentum on the sales.

157,1-11-2019,Efficient capital user stocks bled in toxic debt-led correction. Now what?,"The painful bear hammering, led mainly by toxic debt and punitive government policies, seen in domestic equities over the past few months did not spare even quality companies. This is why as the market shows first signs of a bounceback, stocks that have been maintaining robust return on capital employed (RoCE) for last 10 years should be the first ones to draw investor attention.Chances are that some of these stocks would emerge frontrunners and deliver handsome returns to investors in the coming months.RoCE measures capital efficiency of a business. It is a measure of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for every rupee of capital (equity and debt) employed in the business.Investing in companies with higher RoCE can reap rich rewards if it can maintain higher capital efficiency on new capital as well. In short, higher RoCE indicates better capital efficiency, which can will lead to better wealth creation for shareholders.As many as 67 per cent of stocks that have a record of maintaining an RoCE of 15 per cent have lost up to 80 per cent of value in this correction.You Might Also Like:Slowdown strikes SIP-enriched MF industry: Indiabulls AMC cuts jobsWith an 80 per cent fall since January 2018, TPL Plastech emerged as biggest loser on the list. It was followed by Wimplast (down 73 per cent), Kitex Garments (down 72 per cent), NBCC (down 71), eClerx (down 71 per cent), RPP Infra (down 69 per cent), Care Ratings (down 60 per cent) and Zee Entertainment (down 59 per cent).Zee shares were under pressure through most the year, as worried investors sold the stock amid concerns that lenders may redeem pledged shares. The company has since managed to bring in some strategic investors.    BSE benchmark Sensex has advanced 18 per cent since January 2018 amid select buying in blue chips, while broader market indicators BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices dipped 18 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively.You Might Also Like:Stockbrokers up for a shakeup, and there is a Buffett hand in it“Some quality midcaps got hit badly in this selloff in tandem with companies that had corporate governance issues. This is an opportunity to buy,” says Vijay Kedia, MD, Kedia Securities.“There are very few good stocks in the market right now and they may have bottomed out. We may not see any V-shaped recovery in the companies that have issues. They may recover partially, but it is very difficult to say if they will make money,” he said.Data available with Ace Equity showed there are 117 companies that have been maintaining an RoCE of at least 15 per cent on BSE since 2009. Analysts believe after a steep correction such stocks can be good options to look at.“Investors should look for such stocks, but there is a caveat. One cannot go by historical RoCE alone. One should look for prospective RoCE before taking any investment decision. In the current environment, several businesses have undergone massive business model changes, and hence, one needs to figure out how the RoCE will pan out in the future,” says Prabhakar Kudwa, Director, Samvitti Capital.You Might Also Like:Indian Oil disappoints Street; buy, sell or hold?Meanwhile, among the chart toppers some stocks like NIIT Technologies, Asian Paints, Vinati Organics, Berger Paints, Dr Lal Pathlabs, Astral Poly Technik, Tata Consultancy Services, HUL, HDFC Bank, Relaxo, Titan, Morganite Crucible, Pidilite, L&T Infotech have rallied between 30 per cent and 133 per cent in this period.   Analysts feel many of these stocks have room to grow on the upside. Centrum Broking still has a ‘buy’ rating on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 2,042. BoBCAPS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda, has an ‘add’ rating on NIIT Technologies with a price target of Rs 1,600.IDBI Capital Market is bullish on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs 1,490, while ICICIdirect has a ‘buy’ rating on Dabur India with a price target of Rs 550.Some of these companies, which had debt in excess of Rs 1,000 crore as of March 31, delivered negative returns to investors in last 22 months.For instance, ONGC had a consolidated debt of Rs 1,07,640 crore at the end of FY19. The stock declined 26 per cent between January 1, 2018 and October 29 this year.Wipro, Dilip Buildcon, Godrej Consumer Products, Coromandel International, Hindustan Zinc, Aarti Industries, Coal India, Redington and Zee Entertainment had debt ranging from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore as of March 31, Ace Equity showed.Kolkata-based Abhishek Basumallick, Founder and Chief Equity Advisor of Intelsense Capital, says looking at RoCE alone may not help. However, it is a very good starting point to spot stocks.“Any company that can earn a decent RoCE over longer periods, especially if it is above its cost of capital, will be able to sustain the business and flourish,” he said.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","Thank you for summarizing this article.

167,1-11-2019,Global funds dump company bonds as credit worries persist,"By Divya PatilForeign investors’ net sales of Indian rupee company bonds rose to the highest in five months, as the slowest economic growth in six years and credit market strains weighed on sentiment.Overseas funds pulled Rs 2,640 crore ($372.2 million) in October, making it the seventh straight month of outflow and the longest streak since 2016, according to National Securities Depository. While foreign investors only account for a small share of India’s corporate debt purchases, their retreat adds to pressures at a time of record defaults amid a shadow banking crisis.India’s central bank has already cut interest rates five times in a row to spur spending, while the government has taken a series of fiscal steps to boost growth, including a $20 billion cut to corporate taxes. Concerns that the government will borrow more to fund its fiscal deficit, and a sharp jump in credit spreads in October as credit strains deepened, are also making some overseas investors wary. Bloomberg “Smart money is leaving to take profit and will continue to do so,” said Tongli Han, chief investment officer at Deepblue Global Investment Ltd. A lack of progress in strengthening the nation’s banking sector, and better prospects for other emerging market currencies than the rupee, are also reasons, according to Han.The extra yield demanded by investors to buy top-rated three-year corporate paper over government bonds climbed 26 basis points to 116 last month. That’s the biggest increase in a year.Not all investors are pessimistic. Some signs that the economy may improve have also emerged.“Even with issues in the banking sector, Indian local bonds have delivered solid returns over the last year,” said Kenneth Akintewe, senior investment manager at Aberdeen. “Valuations remain compelling in better quality issuers.”Troubles in India’s credit market began last year when major shadow bank IL&FS Group unexpectedly defaulted, prompting broader shock that made it hard for many companies to refinance debt.

Pretomanid, a new oral treatment is a shorter more convenient option for people with extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB. The dossier for getting approval for the drug has been filed with the drug regulatory authorities. India not only records highest number of TB cases but also bears the maximum burden of XDR TB patients.“India is the first country where Pretomanid dossier was filed. It happened in July even before FDA approval and clearly it shows the intent of the TB alliance and Mylan to get the drug into India quickly. The discussions with the drug controller have begun, meeting already happened to understand the data. India requires clinical trial to introduce new drugs in the country but there is also a process to waive those clinical trials based on unmet medical need and so given the poor outcomes with XDR patients in India, and the time it will take to generate local data which means you would lose a lot of patients those who could have been saved if one waits for clinical trial…a waiver of clinical trial is being discussed and a meeting did happen,” said Sandeep Juneja, TB Alliance, Senior Vice President – Market Access of the TB Alliance.Juneja said that TB Alliance is hopeful that the process will go well and quickly and hopefully there will get a waiver to launch the drug in India. “If not one will have to see whatever pathway is suggested by the regulator to bring the drug quickly to India,” he added.Pretomanid is the first TB drug to be developed and approved as part of a ready-to-use treatment regimen. It is a cocktail of antibiotic drugs which consists of TB Alliance’s Pretomanid in combination with linezolid and bedaquiline (Bpal) for those TB patients who are non-responsive to other line of treatments.A newly approved three-drug treatment has been priced at $1,040 for a complete regimen and will be available at $364 per treatment course. It is only the third new medicine approved for drug-resistant tuberculosis in about 40 years, after Johnson and Johnson’s bedaquiline and Mylan and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s delamanid.The price of the drug has been criticised by humanitarian organisation MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières) which has demanded that the price of Pretomanid be halved to $500 for a patient. However, drug manufacturing company Mylan which has collaborated to make the experimental drug Pretomanid accessible, said that at this point they are not looking at changes in the pricing of the drug.“We are really proud of this price and it reflects our current cost of production. At much higher volumes lower cost is possible and we think it’s a good price. We have to agree on specific terms with the government in India there might be variations in price for India but those will be small variations,” said Anil Soni, global head of infectious diseses, Mylan.Experts say that the accessibility of drug will change the face of TB fight. While the trials of the drug were conducted in parts of Africa, Francesca Conradie, chief investigator in the trial is not doubtful of its efficacy. “There is no reason to suspect that the way it has changed the fight against TB in South Africa it would not be repeated in other countries. The organism is pretty much the same. The first time someone ever got treated with this regimen was 2015 as part of the trial, four years later we have the approved treatment.”"," Hyderabad-based drug pharmaceutical major Mylan and TB Alliance, a non-profit drug development organization are in advanced discussions with India's drug regulator to launch their newly approved drug Pretomanid in India.

We have to take this as a public heath emergency as it will have adverse health impacts on all, particularly our children.""Under these circumstances, he said, construction activities, hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida will remain closed till morning of November 5.The blanket of haze over Delhi thickened on Friday morning with the national capital's pollution levels increasing overnight.Bhure Lal said pollution touched ""severe plus"" levels early on Friday morning but came back to ""severe"" category later. According to official data, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) at 1 pm on Friday was recorded at 480, which falls in the ""severe"" category.An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'.

171,1-11-2019,World’s most profitable company pays surprisingly little,"By Anders MelinThey run the world’s most profitable company, oversee one-tenth of global oil output and their decisions help shape the fate of a nation. Their paychecks, however, are a little less grandiose.Saudi oil giant Aramco is a cash cow for the kingdom, allowing the royal family to wield power with a drip-feed of petrodollars. For executives, it’s a relatively modest life compared with some of their peers elsewhere.Last year, top management and board members—about 17 people in total—split roughly $30 million worth of compensation and benefits. That was half of what rivals Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. handed their executives and directors, though they would have been subject to income tax whereas Saudi nationals aren’t. Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser collected no more than a $5 million package in 2016 as the company began preparing its protracted initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said. That was less than a fifth of what Exxon’s then-CEO Rex Tillerson received at the time.Even when taking into account the tax regime and other perks like secluded housing with private pools, the numbers are hardly staggering compared with the grand plan for the company.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants Aramco valued at a spectacular $2 trillion when the government eventually sells shares in it, the centrepiece of the biggest economic transformation since the firm was brought under state control in the 1970s. Inside the C-suite, senior executives for decades have been schooled in the mantra that long-term success trumps all other priorities. It’s about the future of the kingdom, not personal enrichment.“This is the lifeblood of Saudi Arabia,” said Ellen Wald, who runs her own energy and political consulting firm and is author of the 2018 book “Saudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom’s Pursuit of Profit and Power.” Senior leaders “see themselves as stewards of this incredible national resource,” she said. Bloomberg Aramco hasn’t publicly revealed compensation details beyond the aggregate figures, which were included in an April bond prospectus. A spokesman for the Dhahran-based company, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., said the policy is to remunerate managers in a manner that’s consistent with Aramco’s strategy and objectives. More details may emerge should Aramco move ahead with its long-anticipated public listing, which has been delayed repeatedly, in part because investors are concerned that the proposed valuation is too high. The IPO process will start on Sunday and shares of Aramco will start trading on the Saudi stock exchange on Dec. 11, Saudi television news channel Al Arabiya reported this week. Prince Mohammed wants to sell part of the firm to outside investors to underpin his “Vision 2030” package of reforms. The goal is to diversify the economy, slash unemployment and reduce the reliance on oil.There has been plenty of reason to speculate about lavish payouts for executives. In Europe and the U.S., there’s usually at least a cursory relationship between a company’s size and profitability and what it pays top brass.Aramco booked a staggering $111 billion in profit last year, more than what five of its biggest rivals—Exxon, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SA—earned together. And the IPO target would make it the world’s most valuable public company, surpassing other oil giants by multiples.The firm’s oil revenues also have long helped finance the lives of members of the House of Saud, whose collective net worth is estimated at more than $100 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.But Aramco board members have been dismissive of compensation packages sized according to U.S. standards, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. Directors were also skeptical of incentives that could push employees to maximize short-term results at the expense of long-term performance, the people said.“There’s this feeling of intergenerational equity of the stewardship of Saudi oil that’s been a really strong part of Aramco’s mission,” said Jim Krane, an energy research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute. It’s about “preserving the oil for future generations.”The board has explored ways to align Aramco’s executive compensation with U.S. and European standards to appeal to international investors, people familiar with the matter said. Directors have mulled stock grants and long-term incentive awards, which often make up the bulk of executive pay at Western firms.The board has also weighed granting equity awards to all Aramco employees, one of the people said. Nasser’s pay package mainly consisted of salary and deferred compensation, they said.  Bloomberg There are also big pay disparities between Aramco and other large oil companies controlled by governments. Regulatory filings show that members of the management board of Russia’s Rosneft PJSC split an aggregate $63.9 million in 2018, while a dozen directors and senior bosses of PetroChina Co. got a total of $1 million that year. However, rules and customs for disclosure and classification of executive compensation vary greatly between jurisdictions, making such figures hard to compare.Working at Aramco, for example, comes with many benefits beyond salaries. Jobs at the company are highly coveted among Saudis. Top candidates are sometimes recruited as early as their teens. A job offer can be a ticket to a university education in the U.S., career-long job security and immense prestige back home.Things get even better for those who make it to the senior ranks. Current and former executives, and their families, mainly live in Ar-Rabiyah, an enclave in northern Dhahran that’s filled with opulent mansions with pools.They enjoy a wide range of services and benefits paid for by Aramco, like cars and drivers, gardening and housekeeping, people familiar with the matter said. Contracts for senior executives also include health insurance for the person’s wife, or wives, one of the people said.“You’re basically a rock star if you work for Aramco,” Krane said. “It’s one of the only meritocracies in Saudi Arabia.”Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy"," As an AI assistant, I can provide you with information and resources related to wealth creation, but I am not capable of creating wealth myself.

How have you looked at the earnings picture so far?We have been positively surprised. Earnings have been better than what Street projected but just a small caveat. Street got a bit bogged down by the auto numbers, the quick data that comes in every month. Those numbers have not been good. However, other spaces do get impacted by how the inventory moves from factories to the retail channel and this time around, the festival season was a bit ahead versus last year and part of the inventory would have moved in Q2 versus what would have moved in Q3 last year.  There is a sense that Q2 numbers would look better than expectations while Q3, where people are very positive, may look at tad softer. . We had discussed this internally. However, if you go forward, Q3 has a very low base effect as that was the start of the NBFC crisis last year and it was the first really soft quarter.  The fourth quarter four of last year was good and that will be the base this year. But once again, Q1 and Q2 of this year would be the base next year. Over the next four quarters, you have a low soft base for three quarters. We would tend to see strong YoY growth over the next one year and that is something to look forward to.You Might Also Like:Over the next 3 years, earnings may grow 15-20%: Manish Gunwani What is the outlook on stocks that have had a chequered past? The likes of YES Bank, Essel Group, RBL Bank, Indiabulls -- it is a pretty extensive list, given that some of them have been able to weather the storm and seen some positive news flow post that. For investors, does it make sense to take bets on these names or is it a complete avoid?Many of these businesses had structural problems to start with. Housing finance business has inherent ALM mismatch and if you lend too much to builders where inventories are stuck, you have a bigger problem. On paper, a lot of these businesses look good and you can have a very strong growth. There are weaknesses in these businesses and over the last eight years, we have not ventured around to any of these businesses.  We do not see ourselves venturing into most, if not all, of these names going forward as well. Today, we are undergoing a very strong reform phase. The going gets tougher for businesses which have as yet not been able to find their feet in the marketplace. As reforms are carried out and more rules and regulations are in place, we get more formalised, more organised and some of these businesses will find it even tougher. Besides the names that you have taken, it will be broadly true for the mid cap and smallcap stocks.  To my mind mid and smallcaps do well in a stable rule regime, a good growth backdrop etc. Rules change when growth is slow this is a part that is best to stay away from. Are you looking at cyclicals as a theme to play out going forward? What would look attractive within that theme?So with a backdrop of soft global economic outlook, commodity businesses are not something that we are doing. While some of them look reasonably valued for a very long period, investors may have to start to look there. But we are not looking into this space and are looking at businesses which benefit from the softness in commodity prices. You Might Also Like:Broader market attractive from a 3-5-year perspective: Tushar Pradhan, HSBC Global Our thesis for some time has been to look at users of commodity with pricing power. In a soft economy, the improvement in gross margin, even with some small amount of sales increase would end up driving PBT increases. In durables, FMCG, etc, you have seen almost without exception, an improvement in gross margins and some small sales increase as well, which has resulted in a sharper increase in PBT line. We will stay put there for some more time. What about the PSU theme? Are you closely looking at Concor, BPCL, SCI? We are following the space. It is a very cheap space and if the government changes the manner of disinvestment into the public markets and prefers the strategic route, that is very, very welcome. Strategic value of these businesses would be significantly higher than what the market place will provide. It has got two benefits – one, the crowding out effect in the domestic market does not happen; FDI and longer-term money come in. The valuation that the government gets is better and so all round benefits.  Yes some of these businesses are very cheap. BPCL, Concor all are good businesses and should find a lot of traction. Some of these businesses are fully valued on domestic cost of capital but offshore, even if you assume a 2% borrowing cost and a 3% to 4% rupee depreciation at a 5- 6% incremental cost of money for many of the offshore bidders, the valuations that these businesses can command can be substantially higher.  So yes, we are looking at this space closely but then we are also aware that this would be in most cases, a one-time big pop and that is not something that we do for our clients’ portfolios. We want to stick to businesses which can compound earnings over a long period of time and increase valuation gradually. So PSU are not our thing, but yes we are clued on.You Might Also Like:Land, labour reforms more important than STT & DDT relief: Saurabh MukherjeaConnect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy", Great summary!

179,1-11-2019,View: Global outlook could be worse than 'low for long',"By Roberto AzevedoAt last week’s meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, I repeatedly heard the same dismal view: The global economy is in for low growth and historically low interest rates for a long time.“Low for long” isn’t even the worst of it. In the event of a new recession, governments have limited monetary and fiscal firepower to stoke demand. The economic and political fallout of a serious downturn could get ugly.Does it have to be this way? Certainly not, if governments address the causes of the current slowdown. Most of the finance ministers, central bankers and officials gathered in Washington had no trouble naming the biggest single factor: Trade tensions, they believe, are now the main thing holding growth back. Economists at the World Trade Organization agree. They estimate that global merchandise trade will grow by only 1.2% in 2019. As recently as April, their projection was 2.6%. This is a dramatic deceleration.Two conclusions emerge from the data. First, uncertainty about access to markets and inputs is causing businesses to postpone investment. This means less output and job creation. Rising trade protection also means that capital and labor get deployed less efficiently. Underinvestment and misallocated resources in turn weaken productivity, leading to further losses in output and trade. Weak investment might already be holding trade back: New data suggest it will grow only half as fast as output this year.Second, slower growth in output and trade appears to be synchronized across regions. It’s the dangerous obverse of a coordinated recovery, in which demand in one region supports growth in another. Today, no single region or major economy is growing strongly enough to pull the world out of the ditch.The surest way out would be for governments to work together, while moving to bolster growth at home. Reducing trade-related uncertainty would be valuable in its own right and would boost the efficacy of whatever monetary and fiscal headroom countries still have. But there’s little sign of such cooperation.On the face of it, the new trade restrictions don’t amount to much: So far, they account for less than 5% of world merchandise trade. But this is to understate their impact. The real damage to growth arises from uncertainty over future market access for all goods and services. Before committing resources to a new project, businesses want to understand the risks. If new tariffs might wipe out profits, investors will pause, regardless of how cheap capital might be. In this way, trade uncertainty increases the danger that low interest rates will drive funds into riskier, higher-yielding financial assets. That kind of investment doesn’t add to capacity or improve productivity. Instead, it exacerbates financial volatility and fragility.Failure to cooperate on trade also makes fiscal stimulus less effective. Increased public spending may come with calls to prevent demand from being met by foreign suppliers, reducing the benefits of a coordinated fiscal push. A decade ago, coordinated fiscal stimulus and a commitment to avoid protectionism helped countries bounce back from the worst of the 2008-09 crisis faster than would otherwise have been possible. That’s a far more promising approach.To restore confidence to the global economy, rolling back the trade restrictions introduced over the past two years would be an important start — but only a start. Ending the most conspicuous “trade wars” and making progress on bilateral trade agreements can yield fast results, but the gains aren’t secure. Growth built on strong structural foundations requires a broader approach, involving more governments and firmer multilateral commitments.Governments have an excellent opportunity to make progress of that kind and send a signal that they are ready to break the cycle of underinvestment and slow growth. They can commit to complementing ongoing bilateral processes with wider engagement — at the Group of 20, the World Trade Organization and other multilateral forums — to restore order to global trade.“Low for long” is eminently avoidable — if policy makers resolve to end the uncertainty that is now threatening to become entrenched. If they fail, and let impediments to trade persist or get worse, their citizens had better brace themselves for what lies ahead.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of economictimes.com, Bloomberg LP and its owners)Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy"," Roberto Azevedo is a former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In this article, he discusses the current state of the global economy and the challenges it faces due to trade tensions and uncertainty. He believes that governments need to work together to address these issues in order to promote growth and stability in international trade. Azevedo suggests that reducing trade-related uncertainty would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, but he acknowledges that this is not likely to happen without concerted action from all countries. The article highlights the importance of cooperation among governments and multilateral institutions in promoting economic growth and addressing global challenges like trade tensions."
180,1-11-2019,Diluting government stake below 50 per cent in PSBs no solution: Unions,"KOLKATA: Associations of employees and officers of public sector banks (PSBs) have expressed disagreement with Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee's view that the government should privatise PSBs to tackle the crisis in the sector, asserting that diluting the Centre's stake in PSBs is ""no solution"". Instead, the unions said, ensuring ""proper governance in the system"" and ""removing political interference"" will address the problem of NPAs that has been weakening the financial health of the PSBs. During his recent visit to India, Banerjee said there is need to bring down the stake of the government to below 50 per cent in PSBs so that decisions could be taken without the fear of Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). ""We do not know how privatisation of PSBs will tackle the crisis in the sector? The NPA problem is mainly due to economic slowdown, lack of governance in the system and political interference. Dilution of the Centre's stake is no solution,"" United Forum of Bank Unions' convenor (West Bengal) Siddhartha Khan told . Echoing Khan, All India Bank Officers' Confederation joint general secretary Sanjay Das said reducing the government's stake in PSBs to below 50 per cent to take the bankers out of CVC ambit is no panacea. ""It is a fact that bankers are often harassed in the default cases without addressing the root cause of the NPA issues, but the presence of CVC provides checks and balances in the system,"" Das said. In August, the CVC constituted the Advisory Board for Banking Frauds headed by former Vigilance Commissioner T M Bhasin to examine bank fraud over Rs 50 crores and recommend action. The banking system has been afflicted by the scourge of high NPAs for nearly five years, which has led to erosion of net worth and unfolding of scams in the sector, with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC) being the new addition. ""We have been advocating proper governance in the system and removal of political interference as these will address the problem of NPAs. Unfortunately, political parties who come to power derive political mileage through loan melas and loan waivers,"" Das said. Khan, also working president of All India SBI Staff Federation, said, ""If the government's stake is brought down to below 50 per cent in the PSBs, which will provide loans under PM Mudra Yojana or advances under the 59-minute loan scheme and many other programmes. ""The government controlled PSBs provide loans in these schemes, though we know a fraction of these loans may not be recovered. Had a proper governance system been in place, the banks would not face the NPA problem,"" he said. ""We do not know in what context Abhijit Banerjee had said that, but we are against dilution of government holding in the public sector banks. It will provide no solution to the NPA problems,"" Bank Employees Federation of India's Vice President Pradip Biswas told . Instead of accepting haircut or writing-off bad loans, the government should ""initiate criminal proceedings against the wilful defaulters"" to address the NPA problem in the banking sector, he added."," The article reports that employees and officers of public sector banks have expressed disagreement with Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee's view that the government should privatize PSBs to tackle the crisis in the sector, asserting that diluting the Centre's stake in PSBs is ""no solution"".

The drug would be used for treating critical limb ischemia or CLI. The United States Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) issued a notice of allowance to grant the patent for the method of treating ischemia by administering pooled allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells, said the company in a press release.Stempeucel is derived from allogeneic pooled mesenchymal stromal cells extracted from the bone marrow of healthy, adult voluntary donors. CLI is a progressive form of peripheral arterial disease, which blocks the arteries in the lower extremities resulting in reduced blood flow. It is a debilitating disease which affects patients with severe pain in the feet or toes. Insufficient supply of blood flow leads to the development of sores and wounds in the legs and feet. If it is left untreated, patients may finally have to undergo the amputation of the affected limb as the last treatment option. In the US, the most common current treatments for CLI are characterized by high rates of primary amputations, multiple procedures and high rates of procedure-related complications. The Bengaluru-based biotech firm is currently conducting a Phase 4 trial for CLI due to Buerger’s Disease and a Phase 3 trial for CLI due to Atherosclerotic Peripheral Arterial Disease in India.Stempeutics through its research innovations is demonstrating a firm commitment in bringing new generation of stem cell-based biologics in order to address unmet medical needs, Polani Seshagiri, a stem cell and developmental biologist from the Indian Institute of Science, was quoted saying.

182,1-11-2019,How the Big Bang may have happened decoded,"WASHINGTON: The universe began with the Big Bang, and now scientists have explained how the mysterious explosion may have taken place around 13.8 billion years ago.The Big Bang theory states that all matter that exists today in the universe sprung forth from a single point in an epic explosion.The research, published in the journal Science, details the mechanisms that could cause the explosion, which is key for the models that scientists use to understand the origin of the universe.""We defined the critical criteria where we can drive a flame to self-generate its own turbulence, spontaneously accelerate, and transition into detonation,"" said Kareem Ahmed, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida in the US.""We are using the turbulence to enhance the mixing of the reactions to the point where it transitions into this violent reaction and essentially leads to supernovas, which is exploding stars in simple terms,"" Ahmed, co-author of the study, wrote in the journal.""We are taking a simplified flame to where it's reacting at five times the speed of sound,"" he explained.The team uncovered the criteria for creating a Big Bang-type explosion while exploring methods for hypersonic jet propulsion.""We explore these supersonic reactions for propulsion, and as a result of that, we came across this mechanism that looked very interesting,"" said Ahmad.""When we started to dig deeper, we realised that this is relatable to something as profound as the origin of the universe,"" he said in statement.The key is applying the right amount of turbulence and mixing to an unconfined flame until it becomes self-perpetuating, at which point the flame begins to burn the ingested energy leading to a hypersonic -- exceeding the speed of sound -- supernova explosion.The finding may have applications in faster air and space travel, and improved power generation, including reactions that generate zero emissions as all of the products used in the combustion are converted into energy, the researchers said.The discovery was made by using a unique turbulent shock tube that allowed explosions to be created and analysed in a contained environment, they said.The researchers noted that ultra-high-speed lasers and cameras were used to measure the explosions and help indicate what factors were needed to reach the point where a flame becomes a hypersonic, violent reaction.

183,1-11-2019,"India, Germany to intensify cooperation in combating terror: PM Modi","NEW DELHI: India on Friday sought to add meat to its strategic partnership with Germany by wooing industries to invest in defence corridors of Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.At their biennial summit in New Delhi, India and Germany also sought to give momentum to revive stalled negotiations for free-trade agreement with the European Union. Proposed in 2007, the negotiations hit a roadblock in 2013 when the two sides arrived at an impasse on tariffs and market access. Disagreements on standards and practices exacerbated the situation and negotiations were shelved for five years. Germany has been an advocate of the deal and welcomed the resumption of negotiations last year.The two sides on Friday, in an indirect message to Pakistan, asked it to root out terror havens and prevent the territory from being used for cross-border attacks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called upon all countries to work towards uprooting terror infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels, and reining in movement of terrorists.They stressed on the need for stronger international partnership in fighting terrorism and preventing violent extremism through sharing of information and intelligence inputs and being in full compliance with the rule of law, including human rights law and international humanitarian law.The two leaders stressed on a combined effort to fight the global menace and send out a consistent message that terrorism in all forms and manifestations is not acceptable to the international community.Both New Delhi and Berlin acknowledged the need to deepen bilateral defence cooperation as strategic partners to address security challenges. Germany will work towards facilitating export of military equipment as well as technology sharing with India in line with international, European and national rules, said a joint statement issued after the summit. The two sides signed 22 pacts covering sectors spanning from artificial intelligence to energy and economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called upon all countries to work towards uprooting terror infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels, and reining in movement of terrorists.

We are encouraging the private sector to give more momentum to our increasing participation in trade and investment. Chancellor Merkel and I will meet some of the leading business and industry leaders from both countries,” Modi said at a joint press meet with Merkel.A deeper cooperation in defence must encourage co-development and co-production under the Make-in-India initiative and take advantage of the defence corridors set up in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Maritime projects between the Indian and German naval industries (e.g. submarines) are encouraged in view of the shared interest in the stability of the Indian Ocean region, the joint statement noted in a subtle message for China whose submarines have been active in the IOR. The two leaders underlined the importance of unimpeded commerce and freedom of navigation in accordance with international law, notably the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982.“Both sides agreed to develop stronger cooperation in defence industry, testing and certification, especially for design certification of various systems and sub-systems and quality assurance. The two sides also agreed that major industries of both countries should endeavour to integrate the SME/MSMEs of the other country into their supply chains,” the statement said. The two leaders welcomed a decision to conduct regular dialogue between the defence ministers of the two countries, alternately in India and in Germany, at least once every two years.As the Indo-German strategic partnership turns 20 next year, the two sides on Friday decided to institutionalise the mechanism of the foreign office consultations to be held every year between the foreign secretary of India and the state secretary of the German Federal Foreign Office. They also established a Track 1.5 Strategic Dialogue that will enable key stakeholders to engage annually in an open exchange of views and ideas to enhance mutual understanding of national, regional and strategic interests and to work out recommendations for joint engagement and action on individual policy areas. “We will intensify bilateral and multilateral cooperation to deal with threats like terrorism and extremism. We are grateful to Germany for the strong support of India’s membership in the export control regimes and various international forums. The two countries will continue their cooperation and efforts to expedite other necessary reforms in the Security Council, United Nations and the international system,” Modi said. Merkel and Modi reiterated that the Indo-German strategic partnership was based on the common values and principles of democracy, free and fair trade, and rules-based international order, as well as on mutual trust and respect. Key issues in the discussions included jointly driving the digital transformation through innovation and frontier technologies, especially artificial intelligence, making economic growth sustainable by cooperating in climate change, creating space for people-to-people contacts through legal mobility for skilled labour, and contributing to a reliable international order by strengthening and updating multilateral institutions.BOX Kashmir Crises The conditions in which the people of Kashmir are living are unsustainable and must be improved, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters accompanying her to New Delhi. She said she would raise the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. She said that she was aware of India’s position regarding Kashmir and she wanted to hear Modi’s plans for restoring normalcy there. “The situation for the people there is currently not sustainable and must improve,” Merkel said. – Reuters "," New Delhi seeks to deepen defence cooperation with Germany as strategic partners, seeking to add meat to their partnership by wooing industries to invest in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh's defence corridors. India and Germany also seek to give momentum to revive stalled negotiations for a free-trade agreement with the European Union. Proposed since 2007, the negotiations hit a roadblock in 2013 when the two sides arrived at an impasse on tariffs and market access. Disagreements on standards and practices exacerbated the situation and negotiations were shelved for five years.

Volumes in the EXIM segment saw a decline due to the weak economic activity. What is the outlook in terms of your budgeted estimates?The export-import volumes are subdued now. We thought in the second quarter, we will be able to pick up volumes but the scenario is not encouraging. We could end the first half with volumes a little lower compared to last year. The originating is down by 4% plus and the handling is down by 1.8%.

But practically, I feel that operations will be from 1st of June next year. Once trains start, we will immediately get benefit of that because we are already completely equipped to handle the operations on DFC, our terminals are ready and they are working. They are doing good volumes even today with Indian Railways connectivity. With DFC connectivity, there is absolutely no problem switching on to DFC and carry on these operations.

Are there any strategic initiatives to help boost things?V Kalyana Rama: Hypothetically, if DFC becomes operational by June, then next financial year that is 2021 we will see the positive impact of DFC operations in our balance sheet.  We need not wait for the benefits of DFC to come to us, there is no lead time for that, and no gestation is required because we are equipped for handling the traffic on DFC.

It becomes problematic in a volatile market, particularly if stock prices crash.

196,1-11-2019,"After Pegasus spying row, India asks WhatsApp to explain privacy breach","NEW DELHI: The government on Friday pulled up US social media firm WhatsApp for not disclosing to Indian authorities the details of the spyware attack launched on Indian citizens through the Israeli software Pegasus, despite at least a couple of high-level meetings between the two sides in the past few months.But in a statement issued late Friday, WhatsApp appeared to counter the Indian government, saying it had in May “quickly resolved a security issue and notified Indian and international government authorities.”Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteMITMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisitIIT DelhiIITD Certificate Programme in Data Science & Machine LearningVisitNorthwestern UniversityKellogg Post Graduate Certificate in Product ManagementVisitSenior government officials though argued that while WhatsApp had informed CERT-In, or the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, in May that the app had been hacked globally and that they had fixed the issue, what they failed to tell New Delhi “or hid from us” was the fact that Indian citizens had been affected by it. Snooping row: WhatsApp claims it had warned Indian Govt of a possible security breach earlierAmid the ongoing controversy over snooping row, WhatsApp, on Friday, said that the “privacy and security” of WhatsApp users is its highest priority, adding that it remains committed to the protection of all user messages. “Our highest priority is the privacy and security of WhatsApp users. In May, we quickly resolved a security issue and notified relevant Indian and international government authorities,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said. They added that the communication from the US company in May was “about a technical vulnerability” without any mention of Pegasus or the extent of breach, or that Indians were affected.“We met with their high-ranking executives after that but nobody told us that India had also been hit by the spyware. We learnt of it only through news reports after Facebook/WhatsApp filed the lawsuit,” one of the officials told ET.You Might Also Like:View: WhatsApp spyware episode should be a wake-up call for IndiaWill Cathcart, WhatsApp’s global head, and Nick Clegg, the global public policy head of Facebook, had met Indian authorities including IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in July and September this year, respectively.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesThe hacks took place between April 29 and May 10.A WhatsApp official told ET the firm had written letters to CERT-In informing that a specific number of Indian users were impacted and data was stolen from their smartphones. The official, who did not want to be named, however, said that the Facebook-owned company made public NSO as a culprit only in the lawsuit filed early this week in a US court.Earlier Friday, a team of senior Facebook and WhatsApp executives met Indian officials and said that the company’s headquarters in the US will be responding to the government’s queries on the hacking incident by Monday, November 4.You Might Also Like:Pegasus spyware can target up to 50 phones at onceThe government is awaiting WhatsApp’s response to decide on the future course of action, which could include imposition of penalty. “They are legally bound under Section 70(B) of the IT Act, 2000 to inform us about the details of such attacks (on Indian citizens), which they failed to,” the official said.“Despite our discussions regarding traceability, etc, they never informed us about the attack on Indian citizens but kept harping on how they cannot compromise on encryption,” the official said.In its statement, a WhatsApp spokesperson said: “We agree with the government of India it's critical that together we do all we can to protect users from hackers attempting to weaken security. WhatsApp remains committed to the protection of all user messages through the product we provide.”WhatsApp late October sued the NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance firm and developers of Pegasus, which is reportedly behind the technology that helped unnamed entities hack into roughly 1,400 devices across at least 20 countries, including India, Bahrain, Mexico and UAE, as per the company’s lawsuit in the US.You Might Also Like:Pegasus may have spread its tentacles into several appsThose targeted included diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials. However, the company did not say at whose behest the phones of journalists and activists across the world were targeted.The official cited earlier reiterated that the Indian government hadn’t purchased the Pegasus software from NSO. The Cyber & Information Security (C&IS) division of the ministry of home affairs on Thursday had denied purchasing the software which is at the centre of the alleged snooping row.The government though hasn’t contacted NSO for any details and said the court matter was between WhatsApp and NSO, as per the official.NSO declined to answer ET’s queries on its Indian customers, and disputed Facebook and WhatsApp's allegations.“The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists...,” it said.India is peeved at the timing of this hacking episode, especially the filing of the subsequent lawsuit in the US by WhatsApp and its parent, Facebook. A second official said that India suspects that the lawsuit by Facebook is an attempt to push back growing demand from governments the world over to bring about regulation on traceability.“After India took a stand on traceability, other countries including US & UK are also asking them for the same thing. In fact, Mexico and Brazil have cited the Indian government’s example and asked them to limit forwards,” the official said.The official added that the government is “disturbed by this entire episode, of first not informing us, which they are legally bound to, and secondly, for what we feel is a selective leak of information showing how only government critics have been targeted by the malware”.Government officials further pointed out that Facebook’s US lawsuit came soon after the Indian government informed the Indian Supreme Court that it will be notifying by January the amended intermediary guidelines, which are aimed at tightening accountability rules for social media apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook, especially on traceability.The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) on October 22 informed the Supreme Court that it will need three more months to finalise the social intermediary guidelines. Facebook and WhatsApp filed the case against NSO in a US district Court in California on October 29.“It is too much of a coincidence that this lawsuit comes at a time when we are insisting on traceability…other countries are joining us in this respect and the Supreme Court order asking us for a timeframe for guidelines on traceability,” the second official said.The stalemate between the Indian government and WhatsApp centres around the issue of traceability. The government wants WhatsApp to help India’s law enforcement agencies to track the origin of messages which lead to crimes such as mob lynchings and riots. WhatsApp has refused to do so, citing breach of user privacy and technological challenges.“We don’t want WhatsApp to decrypt any messages, we have only asked them to trace the source of a malicious message. In the past we have seen malicious messages are relayed in the same area, same region and has led to cases of mob lynching and this doesn’t require rocket science,” the official said.WhatsApp has over 1.5 billion users globally, of which India alone accounts for about 400 million.You Might Also Like:House Panel to discuss spying issue on Nov 15Snoop Group: Product of Israeli cyber intelligence firm NSO","The government is still waiting for WhatsApp's response to decide the future course of action, which could include imposition of penalty.

The marketplace is open to all SMEs, including non-ICICI Bank customers.The e-commerce sector has been one of the most significant beneficiaries of the digital and technology transformations that India is witnessing. In turn, the e-commerce sector has ushered in a new era of conducting business in India by transforming the way customers and sellers interact with the marketplace. As per industry estimates, the e-commerce market in India is growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% and is expected to grow to a market of $1.2 trillion by 2021 from the current $200 billion. This would make India the third largest consumer market in the world.The opportunity is evident. Thousands of small players are establishing their own niche and the online retail B2C market is thriving and poised to grow at a phenomenal rate. However, what remains largely untapped, and what could present an unprecedented growth opportunity, is the online B2B marketplace.According to estimates, the online B2B market is set to become six times than B2C e-commerce. Given that there are about 42.5 million micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in India which have 95% of the industrial units and employ 40% of the country’s workforce, it is safe to say that MSMEs will be the driving force that facilitate this rise.

Would you like to offer a comment on this block deal wherein the promoters have sold about 4% stake in the company? What led to it and post that, how is the shareholding looking like and what are the future plans in this regard?The promoters had invested the money in the company in 2012-13 when we acquired Henkel’s stake and that is one which had taken the money against the shares of the promoters. Promoters have sold that to the class investors -- both domestic and financial -- today in the morning and it is 4% worth Rs 260 odd crore. We will be paying off the debt which was there against the shares. With that, now only 6% of the promoters stake will be pledged shares. Rest will be paid off with this transaction and from 67.1% now, promoters’ stake will be coming down to 63%.

Will the entire fund-raising go towards reduction of debt?Entire money will go towards the reduction of debt only, nothing else. In the past also, when they took the debt against the shares, it was only to invest in Jyothy Labs. They had got 8% stake when they invested four years back and out of that, 4% they sold off now to bring down the debt level drastically. Now only 6% is like under debt. We are comfortable with that. A group of investors both domestic and foreign financial institutions have approached us. We felt that it is good to sell to the class investors and they are all AAA investors and we are very happy to have them as our shareholders. So, we sold 4% shares to these marquee investors.You Might Also Like:Jyothy Labs Q1 net rises 11.61 pc to Rs 37.38 croreGood luck with the debt reduction plan. It was something that the Street was talking about and watching very closely. What exactly are the future growth plans from the current level? What is the trajectory is looking like in terms of volume growth and demand from smaller markets?In the first quarter, volume growth was about 5%. The second quarter volume growth went up to 9% and are looking good at this point in time. I am sure the second half of this current fiscal will see a double digit volume growth. They are working towards that and it looks doable. As far as the company’s middle term and long term goals are concerned, we want to consolidate whatever the brands we have and increase the market share by spending a couple of percentage points more on advertisement. By March 2021, our goal is to make our company and promoter debt free. Then we can leverage the balance sheet for inorganic growth which will happen in 2021 and that is what like immediate goals so what we have set up for us. In the near term, over the next couple of quarters, how do you see demand play out? Is the pain over when it comes to consumption slowdown?The pain is not over. It is still there. I am able to see that pain but we are not going down. Industry is not going south, it is going north, but slowly. I would say that second quarter was a shade better than the first quarter; third quarter would be better than the first and second quarters. It is a good indication that probably in a couple of quarters we should be out of so called slowdown. FMCG is one sector which recovers faster than any other sector because it is a daily requirement. People need to buy the detergents and toilet soaps and things like that. So recovery will be faster in FMCG which we are witnessing first. As of now, October has been better than September. I am confident that though it might take a couple of more quarters, but sooner or later, we will be out of the slowdown.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy"," The article reports on the block deal in which the promoters have sold about 4% stake in Jyothy Labs to marquee investors for Rs 260 odd crore.

""While we are sure the Indian Government would be appealing against the ruling of the WTO Dispute Settlement Panel and defending its case with all the logical and fair arguments, the work on a parallel track to make all export -related schemes WTO -compatible should be speeded up, "" said EEPC India chairman Mr Ravi Sehgal . He said while the government has announced a roll-out plan for the Remission of Duties or Taxes on Exports scheme which would be WTO-compliant, the latest ruling of the WTO dispute settlement, on a complaint from the US, ""we need to make sure that no disruption is caused to our exports"". The EEPC India chairman said the country's exports are facing a severe slowdown in the face of rising raw material cost, US-China trade war and non-tariff barriers, besides a crippling deceleration in global trade. Merchandise exports for September, 2019 declined by 6.57 per cent year-on-year. ""Engineering exports, the largest contributor to the country's export basket, too suffered a drop of 6.20 per cent in the September shipments,"" said Mr Sehgal, adding that a wrong impression seems to have been created in the multilateral organisation as if Indian exports are given subsidies of USD 7 billion.""The fact is that the exporters are refunded taxes and duties paid on raw material and the process of value-add. In fact, precious working capital of exporters are held for months ; placing them at a disadvantage against competitors,"" the EEPC India Chairman said.

Mr Sehgal said in the face of global trade slowing down and more and more countries becoming protectionists, ""going seems tough for our exporters.

It directed the telcos to pay the principal due together with interest and penalties within three months.""However, if such a step (complete waiver of all dues) is not possible, we request that the government waive off the interest, penalty and interest on penalty. Since the disputed payments go back to accumulation over the past 14 years, we request that the principal repayment of past dues be done over a period of 10 years, with a two-year moratorium,"" he wrote.The demand made by COAI is exactly the same as the one made in an unsigned paper submitted to the Telecom Ministry on the day Bharti Airtel chief Sunil Bharti Mittal and his brother Rajan Mittal met Prasad and Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio, which is also a member of COAI, has been contesting claims of the inability of telcos to pay the statutory dues, for which they ideally should have provisioned in accounts in view of a legal dispute.Jio says COAI shot off the first representation to the government on October 30 without waiting for its comments. It feels COAI for the benefit of some of its members is using a ""threatening and blackmailing"" tone in its communication to the government on the non-existent crisis in the sector following the Supreme Court ruling on payment of statutory dues.Jio has separately written to Prasad opposing any bailout to telecom companies at taxpayer's expense and asserted the COAI should not be considered an association representing the industry.It has accused COAI of writing to government ""under the influence of two of its members in furtherance of their vested interests"" and accused the association of acting as a ""mouthpiece of two service providers"" and harboring a negative bias towards Jio.There was no case for seeking any financial support from the government after the industry exhausted all its legal recourse, it feels.Mathews in the October 31 letter stated that the support ""will go a long way to ensure that the sector can start the path of recovery from the current situation over time and serve the cause of Digital India.""With the telecom sector staring at a massive Rs 1.4 lakh crore payout following a Supreme Court order, the unsigned memorandum to the government had asked it not to press for adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dispute payment in its entirety, sources said adding the note argues that it could not be the intent of the government to enrich itself by charging licence fee and SUC on non-licensed revenue or income.In the worst-case scenario, it has requested the government to levy only the principal amount (without any interest or penalty) pertaining to only license fee (not spectrum usage charges) that should be allowed to be paid over a period of 10 years without interest.It sought a two-year moratorium on spectrum payments beyond April 2020 till March 2022, to ease the cash flow pressures on the industry without compromising the net present value of spectrum dues to the government. This will allow continuity of business investment in critical network deployment and purchase of additional spectrum, it said.It further sought a reduction in licence fee from 8 per cent of annual revenues to 3 per cent, and said that the balance 5 per cent representing USO contribution be waived or suspended till the current unutilised fund of Rs 50,000 crore is used.

The company said it is betting on the prospects of auto sector, which accounts for 90% of its sales, despite facing headwinds owing to the recent slowdown in automobile sales.“We have decided on a four-year roadmap to grow in India. The plan includes adding capacity at our existing unit by moving into higher value grades of automotive steel and also debottlenecking our current assets to produce more steel,” said Sridhar Krishnamoorthy, managing director, Arjas Steel.“The downturn in automobile sales, particularly in the last six months, has definitely hit us. However, we think it is a temporary phase that will not last long. We continue to remain focused on the longer term prospects of the Indian market,” he said.The Arjas steel plant at Tadipatri, in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, has an installed capacity of 300,000 tonnes of special steel long products per year, focused on automotive, defence, railways and related industries. The initial plan is to increase the capacity to 350,00 to 375,000 tonnes.The company, which has focused on the domestic market so far, is also looking at exports to tide over the slowdown in steel sales in the country. “We would like to target around 10% of our production at the export market.

Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. How has your portfolio been doing? Last couple of days, broader markets have been coming back. I am assuming that the portfolio of PMS orientation usually has a good 30-40-50% chunk of midcaps. You are right absolutely. Our flagship PMS is Emkay Capital Builder. It is a multi-cap PMS and we have a 40-50% allocation to midcaps and smallcaps. In fact, we also run AIF Emkay Emerging Stars fund which is actually only a small cap AIF and we launched this sometime in January 2018.

Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIM LucknowIIML Chief Executive Officer ProgrammeVisitIIM LucknowIIML Chief Marketing Officer ProgrammeVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Technology OfficerVisitWe have been fairly patient about investing our money and we have not invested too much money and that is why we protected a large part of our capital from destruction. But you are absolutely right. The broader market is now seeing some bit of movement and that is a good thing. It was down 40% at some point in time. The smallcap index is now down about 32% odd.  But in the last five-seven trading sessions, we are seeing the advance decline ratio, the breadth of the market is getting better. We are also in the midst of an earning season. Some of the results and commentary are not as bad as one was expecting. That is a good thing and a lot of things are in the price. Commodity is an area which you have avoided but autos are in focus. Mahindra numbers just came in. The stock is at a five-year low right now. There is a sense that perhaps the big recovery may not come. Which part of autos do you like?We have been focusing more on rural auto. We strongly believe that in terms of public transport, there is a huge vacuum as far as the rural markets are concerned. Also this year we have had a beautiful monsoon. So we strongly believe that it is a matter of one or two more quarters and the demand from the rural auto side will be very strong. We are very much focussed on products for the rural market and we expect a huge demand coming in the next couple of quarters.You Might Also Like:Why Prateek Agarwal is avoiding commodity and PSU stocks for now What about financials?

But how good are things in the healthier ones -- ICICI, Axis Bank?We strongly believe that the couple of names that you mentioned have a great outlook. If you look at it their liability franchise, the CASA today is a good 40-50% for these banks. Second, last five-seven years, we have had a fairly rough patch as far as the corporate NPAs and the quality of the assets were concerned. These banks have actually written off a lot of these things out. The worst is behind us and within the valuations, if you see the gap between the best bank today in the country versus this number two and number three, there is still a decent gap. We believe the fact that the top level management have completely changed and in their commentary, they are coming out with a complete no nonsense approach and clear growth guidance of at least 15-20% for the next two-three four years. We strongly believe it is a good secular growth story for the number two, number three, number four bank of the country. Second quarter estimates were so low this time that people are getting positively surprised that the actual numbers are not as bad as they thought. Commentary is not very negative for many managements. Tell us a couple of instances which you have observed.Yes, the credit goes to some of these auto companies because in spite of huge double digit volume degrowth, for the September quarter, their margins were fairly stable or probably a little better. So the negative operating leverage did not really play out as much. Basically they have done a decent cost rationalisation. They have got better realisations. So the profit dip was not as bad as one would have expected. From that perspective, autos have done a decent job. What about hospitals? A lot of managements are taking proactive help to reduce their pledges. There are hospitals which are getting listed and generally the health of the sector has improved. Is there a strong case to look at this space?I do believe so. We have seen a consolidation in this sector now. Companies are now trying to get optimum utilisation of their capacities. There is now a decent amount of clarity in terms of regulations also. There are still a couple of challenges but that will also get sorted out very quickly. From that perspective also, the worst is over for this sector and the managements are much more focussed in terms of generating good ROCs for the shareholders.You Might Also Like:Commercial real estate may do better in 2019 compared to last year: Anuj Puri, Anarock Property What are the unique plays which are available now?

225,1-11-2019,Coal India unlikely to meet FY20 profit target despite a cut,"KOLKATA: Coal India aims at a net profit of Rs 14,664 crore for this fiscal – lower than Rs 17,462 crore it had secured a year ago – and a marginal rise in its gross revenue to Rs 1.5 lakh crore from Rs 1.4 lakh crore.Analysts, however, are sceptical about the company meeting its target despite a lower profit outlook.The state-run miner is working to boost its net revenue from operations to Rs 1 lakh crore from Rs 92,896 crore in 2018-19.“Financial targets are kept modest which are generally surpassed by the company. Additionally, the ministry takes account of the prices of coal and the rise in input costs as well. Keeping all these factors in view, the target for profit after tax has been kept at a level lower than achieved last year,” a senior Coal India executive said.According to an agreement Coal India signed with the coal ministry, if the company manages to produce 660 million tonnes of fuel this year, it would be rated ‘Excellent’ and if it secures 80% of its target, the rating would be ‘Very Good’.Analysts believe that Coal India would, however, miss its production target this year. ICRA Ratings has estimated that production will fall short by around 55-75 million tonnes (MT). In such a scenario, its ratings would be ‘Poor’.The company’s April-September output fell 6% because of floods and labour problems as against a 7% rise a year ago.“In order to achieve the targeted annual coal production or produce anywhere close to the annual guidance of 660 MT, Coal India would have to step up production to the average of 2.3 MT per day for the rest of the year. This looks unlikely, given that in recent times, the central miner has been able to briefly sustain its 2-MT-per-day average production rate only in March 2018 and March 2019,” said Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president and group head for corporate sector ratings at ICRA.The rating agency has also indicated that domestic auction prices for coal had been declining steadily between January and June and a large part of Coal India’s profit comes from e-auctions.Its average premium for spot e-auctions fell from 131% in December 2018 to 55% in June 2019. With production declining by 5.1% and 10.3% Y-o-Y in July and August 2019, respectively, spot e-auction premia started rising, inching up to 62% and 87% in July and August of 2019.Spot prices remained elevated in September and are likely to hold firm in October as well as CIL’s production remains constrained by the late retreat of the South-West monsoon to mid-October."," This article reports that Coal India, a state-run miner, aims to achieve a net profit of Rs 14,664 crore for this fiscal, which is lower than its previous year's target of Rs 17,462 crore. Despite this, the company still plans to raise its gross revenue to Rs 1.5 lakh crore from Rs 1.4 lakh crore. However, analysts are skeptical about Coal India meeting its targets due to higher input costs and floods affecting production. The article also notes that the company's average premium for spot e-auctions has decreased and that production is down by 5% in July and August. Additionally, the government expects Coal India to produce 660 million tonnes of fuel this year, but the company plans to produce only around 62% of its target due to production constraints caused by late monsoons.

The government is also working on tightening rules of social media companies in India that will increase the accountability of such platforms.WhatsApp on Tuesday filed a lawsuit in a California federal court against NSO Group, which allegedly developed the spyware, saying an attempt was made to infect approximately 1,400 ""target devices"" globally with malicious software to steal valuable information from those using the messaging app.WhatsApp had said it ""believes the attack targeted at least 100 members of civil society... this number may grow higher as more victims come forward"".NSO had denied the allegations and said it provides ""technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime"" and is not ""designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists.""

236,1-11-2019,Earnings growth may hit double digits in FY20: Shibani Sircar Kurian,"We will possibly end the year with lower double digit earnings growth which comes after a significantly long period of time. That sets the overall tone for next year in terms of FY21 earnings, says Shibani Sircar Kurian, Fund Manager, Equity, Kotak Mahindra AMC. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. How have you perceived the recent run up? How much further could it go?The market sentiments clearly have started gaining positive momentum. The broader market seems to have bottomed out and over the last few weeks, we are seeing outperformance in the broader markets.  Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIM LucknowIIML Chief Operations Officer ProgrammeVisitIIM LucknowIIML Chief Marketing Officer ProgrammeVisitIIM LucknowIIML Chief Executive Officer ProgrammeVisitIf you look at the markets, notwithstanding the near term data on growth, there are a few key things we must keep in mind. Number one, the data that came out yesterday shows the resumption in government spending.  Two, with the corporate tax cuts, for the year as a whole, earnings growth being in the lower double digit range means the pace of earnings downgrades are now behind us. That is another clear positive.  Three, monsoons have been better than expected and that bodes well for the winter crop and harvest and cash flows from a rural perspective over a period of time. Taking all of this into account, we believe that the broader markets are poised for an up move over the next 12 to 18 months and from a portfolio perspective, we are looking at opportunities in the midcap space where companies which are growing at a fairly decent pace and which have strong operating cash but are trading at reasonable valuations.You Might Also Like:Why Prateek Agarwal is avoiding commodity and PSU stocks for now But that was the case earlier also. Do you think sentiments have shifted a little bit with this earning season?Yes, that is what I believe that the tax rate cuts have brought two things to the table. a), without the corporate tax rate cuts we would have possibly seen some more earnings downgrades, but now that has reversed and we will possibly end the year with lower double digit earnings growth which comes after a significantly long period of time. That sets the overall tone for next year in terms of FY21 earnings. b) With the corporate tax rate cuts, we have also seen some amount of risk capital coming back and therefore over a period of time, we expect and hope that the investment cycle which has been lagging behind for a fairly long period of time, also starts showing signs of recovery.  c)The very fact that the government spending has started again means that at least public sector capex revival signs will start showing up over the next few months. That again bodes well from an overall investment infrastructure perspective. The market sentiment appears to have changed and from an overall visibility of earnings growth, we are in a far better place today than we were a few months back. A perspective from you on IndiGo?I do not want to talk specifically on a company but from the sector perspective, the sector dynamics in the aviation space is such that there is one clear carrier which is gaining market share. The issue clearly at this point in time is that while excluding Jet, the rest of the segment is seeing passenger growth, the yields continue to remain fairly muted and therefore for profitability to really improve, yields also need to start showing improvement. That is going to be the key in this particular sector going forward. You Might Also Like:Broader market attractive from a 3-5-year perspective: Tushar Pradhan, HSBC Global Oil prices are staying benign, a positive overall from a sector perspective. However, you also mentioned disruptions in terms of capacity additions. That will also have a bearing. This is a sector which is fairly stock specific in nature and where some carriers are gaining market share. The lowest cost carrier at this point in time would have a definite advantage because yields are continuously under pressure despite the fact that you have seen some amount of demand pickup. This is a fairly price elastic segment and yield movement is the key to watch out for. There is a debate on whether or not cyclicals are going to lead the next phase of rally or if there is more opportunity with some of the FMCG/consumption names that have already been preferred by the markets as slightly safer. Which side would you be on?The consumption space has done well. It has been a defensive bet where in this kind of market volatility, there have been a lot of positions that have been built up, given the defensive nature of the sector.  If you look at the stocks, the sector has performed fairly well from an earnings perspective as well. But incrementally, our view is that valuations are stretched and therefore in terms of market move, if you look at the consumption space as a whole, the valuations do not give too much of comfort. There would be some stock specific opportunities, but overall from a sector perspective valuations do appear stretched.  Where we find opportunities is clearly more on the industrials capex segment where over the next 12-18 months, there would be a revival in public sector capex spends. Though not immediate, there would also be some signs of revival in the private sector capex as well. You Might Also Like:Over the next 3 years, earnings may grow 15-20%: Manish Gunwani Therefore sectors like cement, industrials and capital goods are our preferred plays at this point in time from a portfolio perspective. We also like some of the private sector banks, specifically the private sector corporate banks, which are still trading at fairly reasonable valuations. We believe that the reduction in credit costs will start getting visible six months from now, not immediately. But that will also lead to an improvement in terms of their overall profitability and return ratios. That is how we are really positioned across our portfolios. While there are some opportunities even now in the consumption space, but overall, the space does look expensive from a valuation perspective. Given the recent sales figures, everyone is saying that it has been a good uptick but isn’t it still a lot lower than what we saw last year?Yes. We have been cautious in auto space and we continue to remain cautious. We will possibly have to monitor data for the next couple of months as well to take a view in terms of where the things are really turning around. While near term, there has been some positive news flow but numbers still appear to be fairly muted.  Our view is that overall inventory still remains elevated and going into BS-VI, manufacturers would have to get rid of this inventory and that would mean discounts will continue for a period of time. The overall demand scenario really has not improved significantly. So, we continue to remain cautious. Valuations have corrected quite sharply and therefore look fairly reasonable but whether that immediate upswing is going to be visible in terms of numbers, we will still have to wait and watch for the next few months in terms of the monthly numbers and then take a view.  Transition into BS-VI is also going to be difficult, given that the cost of ownership of vehicles is going to rise even further. We will have to see how that impacts the overall demand scenario.  What is your take as to any select sector that has come in as an earnings pop or an earnings surprise or even a specific company that has caught your eye?From an overall earnings perspective, there have not been too many huge deviations or hits and misses on either side. By and large, numbers have been fairly in line with expectations. What we have seen is if you look at the sectors which have declared numbers, specifically on the banking side, in the private sector banks, a couple of trends are clearly visible. One is that the private sector banks continue to gain market share on loans but what is also changing incrementally for them is that they are gaining market share on deposits as well. This was missing over the last couple of years.  Now deposit growth accretion is picking up pace and is catching up with loan growth which bodes well from an overall liability franchise perspective. Also, from a credit cost perspective, a lot of these banks now have shored up their provision coverage. While their credit cost would stay elevated in the near term because of some of the stress in terms of the known names, over a period of time you will start seeing that moderation in credit costs starting to play out.  So, going into next year, a) we will see better profitability and core operating numbers from some of these private sector banks. b), Some of the companies, specifically some of the cement names have been muted demand growth. That means volume numbers have not been that great and some of the pricing up move that you had seen some time back, has also started to contract. Once the public sector capex spend starts to pick up, we will possibly see that there is some improvement in terms of volume numbers and hopefully pricing also starts to improve. That is going to be a key to watch out for. Clearly from a cost perspective, across the board, costs have been fairly under control. That means margins have held up better even though there has been some disappointments on the top line front. Net-net, from an earnings perspective, it has been largely in line with expectations.  We need to see is how this pans out going forward specifically into the second half of the year and then into FY21. The tax rate cuts have also provided the cushion that is required in terms of seeing earnings for the year as a whole.  If you look at Nifty earnings, you will possibly see double digit earnings which comes after a significantly long period of no earnings growth which again bodes well from a market valuation perspective.

237,1-11-2019,Soybean Association urges govt to ask DGFT to release MEIS scrips at 7% for exports,"The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) has urged the commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal to immediately issue necessary instructions to DGFT to release the MEIS scrips at 7per cent for all exports of soybean meal and save the exporters. . From August 1, DGFT has stopped accepting MEIS applications for soybean meal and deactivated the relevant link for online filing of claims. When approached, DGFT office has given the following reply: The MEIS benefit was given in the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020 and notified through a public notice from time to time. The last public notice No. 44/2015-20 dated 5th December, 2017 in this regard notified MEIS benefit of 7 per cent on soybean meal (HS Code 2304) with effect from 1.11.2017, without an end date, making the benefit valid till the end of the current Exim Policy 2015-20, unless withdrawn earlier. The exporters of soybean meal have factored in the 7 per cent MEIS benefit while quoting their rates and a denial of the benefit to them at this time and retrospectively would be wholly unjustified, as it would put therm to irreparable financial losses.

242,1-11-2019,"Delhi hospitals see rise in cases of respiratory, cardiac complications; kids, elderly worst hit","NEW DELHI: As air pollution reached alarming levels in the national capital, hospitals reported a surge in the number of patients suffering from respiratory and breathing complications, with doctors advising residents, especially children and the elderly, to stay indoors as much as possible. Pollution levels in the region entered the ""severe plus"" category on Friday, with the Supreme Court-mandated pollution control body EPCA declaring a public health emergency in Delhi-NCR and banning construction activity till November 5.  With poor air quality prevailing in the national capital for the past three days, there has been a rise in the number of patients visiting out-patient departments (OPDs) or emergencies with respiratory or cardiac related problems.  ""Patients are coming with complaints of watery eyes, cough, breathing difficulty, allergy, exacerbation of asthma and and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD),"" AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said, adding that children and those above the age of 60 are the worst affected when the pollution levels are high.  Besides affecting lungs, high levels of pollutants in the atmosphere cause inflammation in blood vessels and may lead to hardening of arteries which can act as a trigger for stroke or heart attack in persons, already at risk of the disease, Guleria explained.  Vijay Gurjar, assistant professor in the Department of Geriatrics at AIIMS, said that there is around 20-25 per cent rise in footfall of elderly patients suffering from several health issues due to pollution, both at the casualty and OPDs.  Air pollution exacerbates lung conditions and aggravates the condition of those having pre-existing health issues such as asthma, pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases.  ""Those who could be stabilised with medication are now requiring admissions for stabilisation,"" Gurjar said.  Other than the elderly, many young children are also turning up with complaints of cold, cough, sore throat and allergies, said Minakshi Bhardwaj, medical superintendent of RML Hospital.  ""We are advising the parents to limit outdoor activities for the children, especially those already suffering from some kind of respiratory health issues, till the air outside improves. They do need to go out for playing but the weather is not just appropriate for any kind of outdoor activity.  ""Besides, normal adults should also stay indoors as much as possible and the elderly should not go for morning walks as the pollution is at its peak at early morning hours,"" Bhardwaj said.  ""I have started writing it on prescriptions now -- 'please stay indoor' and 'avoid morning walks',"" Gurjar said.  The Delhi government has announced that all schools will be shut till November 5 in the wake of rising level of pollution.  Doctors at several private hospitals also reported around 25-30 per cent rise in footfall of patients at the OPDs and emergencies.  According to Dr Abhinav Guliani, chest physician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, there has been a sudden increase of almost 25-30 per cent patients in the casualty and OPD with breathing difficulty, cough, chest heaviness and infections after Diwali.  Most of the patients coming to the hospital belong to the age group 3-12 years and above 60 years. The number of patients with existing lung diseases requiring admission has also increased.  ""Some of the patients coming to the casualty with these problems are severe enough requiring admission,"" Guliani said.  ""The percentage of people who are complaining of respiratory ailments have majorly increased to about 20 per cent. Our routine patients on the other hand are cancelling their regular visits so as to avoid outdoor pollution,"" Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, Respiratory medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital said. PLB SMN SMN"," The article reports that due to high levels of air pollution in the national capital, hospitals have seen an increase in the number of patients suffering from respiratory and breathing complications.

249,1-11-2019,Looking for opportunities in metals and PSU banks: Yogesh Mehta,"Investors should do their due diligence before investing into midcaps. Those are not sectoral allocations. Those are individual companies which have their own individual reasons to grow, says Yogesh Mehta, Founder, Yield Maximiser. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. Do you think midcaps should do well from here? When the numbers are coming in, some of the stocks are reacting quite sharply. Is that because of low valuations?Yes, that is one part and secondly in the midcaps and smallcaps, as the flows are coming into the mutual funds, they are also having a compulsion to buy those stocks and with better than expected numbers, we are seeing a buying spree. In case of low volumes, the prices surge and this is bound to happen because on an average, a Rs 100 stock has corrected to almost Rs 50, Rs 40 and Rs 35 level. Already there are no sellers and investors are there. The weak hands and the leveraged hands are already out from those stocks’ list basket. That is why it is bound to happen. It is a natural psychology and that is why we see such kind of spurt in good quality names. I would say that investors should do their due diligence before investing into midcaps. Those are not sectoral allocations. Those are individual companies which have their own individual reasons to grow.

Fortis is one.  Metropolis is a company where one can look at on the investment side from current prices and that give you better returns over short to medium term.  What are your thoughts on some of the MNC names? They have returned shareholders some pretty healthy gains so far.The biggest plus point for investing into MNC companies is that they are much better on the compliance side. The growth rate is higher because they are global companies and they have got a shelter there. You Might Also Like:Earnings growth may hit double digits in FY20: Shibani Sircar Kurian Secondly, ROEs and ROCEs are much better. In the last one year, we have seen so many compliance issues and many of the companies have gone from Rs 150 or Rs 350 or Rs 500 stock to zero or almost zero. This will not happen in MNC stocks. They are regular dividend paying companies. We have seen a good flow into largecap names. Now that money is shifting into those MNC companies, which are dominated by the pharmaceutical names. I would say Sanofi, Astrazeneca among pharma, P&G, Gillette in the consumer segment, all have given better performance and one should look into these companies and are on the safer side. Are you worried at all about the macro indicators given the kind of movement we are seeing on markets?My reading is that though this rally has no relevance with the macro and micro factors, even the global concerns. We are seeing this rally because of the emerging market rally and the US markets are also getting stronger. At home, the crude and the rupee both are finding a strong support and RBI’s stance this time should be a status quo. Overall, macro and micro are very much in favour for the Indian economy as far as we can say that the bigger, larger picture has unfolded once this corporate tax rate cut was announced. The numbers from the corporate earnings would be much better from the third and fourth quarters as well. That is what people have anticipated in advance and that has been projected into the price.

What I would prefer from here is on the cyclical side and on the PSU bank side where I think the asset quality deterioration is much more in control and so slippages are under control. PSU banks would be a better opportunity to get into from here on. PSU banks as well as the metals will provide a good opportunity since US-China trade war has settled somewhat. The China manufacturing index is also showing some better numbers. The prices have corrected almost to a large extent in this basket. So, metals and PSU banks would be the two sectors I would be looking for at the current prices.You Might Also Like:Jyothy Labs expects to be debt free by March 2021: Ullas KamathConnect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","As an AI assistant, I can provide you with information and insights on midcaps, MNCs, and other topics related to wealth management.

251,1-11-2019,Trai mandates minimum call ringer duration of 30 seconds,"KOLKATA: The telecom regulator has mandated a minimum ring duration of 30 seconds for outgoing mobile calls before they are disconnected, and 60 seconds for such calls to landlines, a view that was backed by the older operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea but opposed by Reliance Jio, which wanted a shorter span of 15-to-20 seconds.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) regulation, issued on Friday, though has mandated the terminating or “destination network” to initiate the “force release” or call disconnection process after the specified minimum ring span, and not the originating network. This is since it feels “the terminating network is in the best position to determine the no-answer condition”.Accordingly, Trai has mandated the terminating network to disconnect the incoming call -- in this case -- after the minimum ring span and simultaneously inform the originating network. But in the event, the originating network does not receive the message, it can disconnect the call from its end after 90 seconds.“The Authority is of the view that force release of incoming voice call after specified duration of alert be initiated by the terminating network, (though) in case of abnormal conditions, originating network may force release the call after waiting at least for 90 seconds,” Trai said in its quality of services standards regulation for mobile and landline services.These regulations, it said, would be effective ""after 15 days from the date of publication in the Official Gazette”.The call ring duration issue is at the heart of the interconnect usage charges (IUC) spat between the older carriers and Jio. Bharti Airtel had alleged earlier that Jio had shortened the call ringing time to manipulate the IUC regime. A shortened ring time span meant more missed calls, and therefore greater return calls to the Jio network, enabling the Mukesh Ambani-led telco to cut its net interconnect payouts to the incumbents.IUC is paid by the call originating telco to the destination carrier for carrying its voice traffic. Airtel and Voda Idea are net revenue gainers under the present IUC system, while Jio is a net payer.Jio, on its part, had dismissed the allegations, saying 15-20 seconds call alert span is a globally followed norm. It had further contended that it was the incumbent operators that were gaming the IUC regime by charging their 2G/3G customers high voice tariffs as these customers were unable to move to the more efficient 4G operator owing to not having a compatible device.Back in September, incumbents had told Trai that Jio’s decision to cut ringing time to 20 seconds -- or just 4-5 rings -- had hugely inconvenienced customers. Top executives of Airtel, Vodafone Idea, BSNL and MTNL had subsequently urged the regulator to set the minimum ring time for answering a call to 30 seconds, saying a reduced ring time of 20 seconds was also hurting voice call parameters and changing traffic flow patterns.Jio had, subsequently, increased the ring duration for outgoing calls before they are disconnected to 25 seconds from 20 seconds. It though had said that a longer ring time duration “would unnecessarily engage scarce radio spectrum resources when such calls are unlikely to be answered”.In its discussion paper on how long a phone ought to ring before a disconnection, Trai had also sought views on whether mobile users should be given the option to customise ringing duration to improve customer convenience, and possible ways to do so.In this context, Trai's said feedback from stakeholders suggested new technologies such as AI and machine learning (ML), though potentially useful for customising call ringing spans, are not immediately available in networks currently deployed.It added that Trai may “review the regulation as and when such capabilities become available”."," The article reports on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) latest move to mandate a minimum ring duration of 30 seconds for outgoing mobile calls before they are disconnected, and 60 seconds for such calls to landlines.

259,1-11-2019,Economy facing serious stagnation; govt data is dodgy: Congress,"PANAJI: The economy is headed for serious stagnation which is reflected by the RBI lowering GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal, the Congress said on Friday, while also questioning the government's ""data integrity"". Speaking to the media here, Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha said the government is in a deep sleep ""like Rip Van Winkle"", the famous fairytale character. ""The Reserve Bank itself has lowered India's GDP growth forecast for 2019-20 to 6.1 percent which will be the lowest in last six years,"" he said. It indicated that the country is headed for ""serious stagnation"", he said. The BJP-led Union government's ""data integrity"" itself had become questionable, Jha further said. ""We are being compared to China's dodgy data, pregnant with brazen manipulation. For example, CAG reported that real fiscal deficit could be as astonishingly high as 5.8 per cent, while the government claimed it was 3.46 per cent,"" he said. The Union government seemed to have completely ignored the vital role of agriculture, where 50 per cent of people are employed, in the economy, Jha said. ""The (promise of) doubling farm incomes by 2022 is a complete sham. The agriculture sector grew by a measly two percent during 2014-19 despite excellent monsoons in the last three years, and was almost half of UPA's 3.85 per cent (growth),"" he said. ""The BJP reneged on its promise to give Minimum Support Price by telling the Supreme Court that it would distort market rates. Understandably, farmer protests rose from 628 in 2014 to 4,837 in 2017. ""The real wages of agriculture labour barely rose by one percent in the last few years compared to almost 10-15 per cent in the past decade,"" Jha claimed. The government misread the problem confronting the economy which is a demand contraction created by the ""voodoo economic decision of demonetization and ham-handed execution of the GST"", he said. ""Instead, they are fixing the supply-side, it is like giving someone who is suffering from migraine a foot massage,"" the Congress leader said. ""By appropriating Rs 1.76 lakh crore from the RBI and giving it as a tax bonanza to the corporate sector the government missed an opportunity to boost public expenditure and increase MNREGA outlay and help the MSME sector that would have augmented demand,"" Jha said. ""Instead, most likely the industry will absorb the higher earnings as retained profits given the fact that capacity utilization is at a mere 75 per cent. That is why despite RBI dropping repo rates (it) has had negligible impact on fresh investments which are at 16-year-low,"" Jha said. GST collections are at a ""19-month-low"", signaling slumping consumer purchasing power,"" he added."," The article reports that the Reserve Bank of India has lowered its GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal, and questions the government's data integrity. It also mentions that the Congress is questioning the government's ""data integrity"" and is comparing it to China's dodgy data. The article further states that the BJP-led Union government seems to have ignored the vital role of agriculture in the economy and reneged on its promise to give Minimum Support Price by telling the Supreme Court that it would distort market rates.

263,1-11-2019,"Maharashtra impasse continues; Congress says BJP ""cheated"" Shiv Sena","MUMBAI: The impasse over government formation in Maharashtra continued on Friday, eight days after Assembly poll results were announced, even as the Congress targeted the BJP for ""cheating"" the Shiv Sena. Maharashtra may head for President's rule if the new government in the state is not in place by November 7, Finance Minister and BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said. The tenure of the existing Legislative Assembly ends on November 8. Mungantiwar said the delay in talks between BJP and Sena was due to the Diwali festival, adding parleys will start in a day or two. ""People of Maharashtra have given mandate not to any party but to the Mahayuti (alliance comprising BJP, Shiv Sena and other parties),"" he said. ""Out alliance is stronger than Fevicol or Ambuja Cement,"" he added. ""A new government will have to be in place within the stipulated time, or else the President will have to intervene. President's rule will be imposed if the government formation doesnt happen in the given time,"" Mungantiwar said. The Shiv Sena demanded immediate relief for farmers affected by unseasonal rains in parts of the state. Maharashtra will have chief minister from the Shiv Sena, senior party leader Sanjay Raut said. Talking to reporters here, he said there have been no talks yet between the BJP and Sena on government formation. If the Sena decides, it can get the required numbers to form a stable government in Maharashtra, he said. People have given mandate to form government on the basis of ""50:50 formula"" that was reached in front of the people of Maharashtra, Raut said. In the just-held state polls, the BJP won 105 seats, while the Sena got 56 in the 288-member Assembly. The NCP got 54 and the Congress 44 seats. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party is demanding the CM's post for 2.5 years and 50:50 division of portfolios. Both these demands have been rejected by the BJP which has insisted that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will continue to hold the post for the next five years. In an editorial in its mouthpiece ""Saamana"", the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said farmers who have suffered crop loss should be provided adequate compensation. ""The farmers in the state are awaiting immediate assistance and not a new government,"" the editorial said. The NCP will try to give an alternative if the BJP and the Shiv Sena fail to form government in Maharashtra, the opposition party's chief spokesperson, Nawab Malik, said on Friday. Malik's comment came even as senior party leader Ajit Pawar has maintained the NCP will sit in the opposition along with the Congress. Ajit Pawar said late night on Thursday that the people of the state have asked his party to sit in the opposition, as reflected in the election results, and it will do so. Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam criticised his party leaders who are mulling supporting the Shiv Sena in formation of the next government in Maharashtra. ""Congress should not get into Shiv Sena-BJP drama. It's fake. It's their temporary fight to grab more power share,"" said the ex-MP, who is miffed with party leadership over ticket distribution for the October 21 polls. ""To the best of my understanding, Shiv Sena will never come out of BJP's shadow,"" said Nirupam, who was associated with the Bal Thackeray-founded party before joining the Congress. Meanwhile, senior state Congress leaders were in Delhi on Friday to apprise the party leadership of the political situation in Maharashtra. MPCC chief Balasaheb Thorat said there is political instability in the state and blamed the BJP for the same. ""Our stand now is wait and watch,"" Thorat said. His predecessor and former CM Ashok Chavan said the BJP has cheated the Shiv Sena as is evident from the senior ruling alliance partner not willing to abide by what was decided between the two parties before the elections."," The article reports that the impasse over government formation in Maharashtra continues after the recent state polls, with the Congress targeting the Bharatiya Janata Party for ""cheating"" the Shiv Sena.

265,1-11-2019,"Google, Walmart help drive India payments past 1 billion transactions","By Saritha RaiA payments platform created by India’s largest retail banks surpassed a billion transactions in October, a milestone that affirms the tremendous growth of services offered by U.S. giants from Walmart Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. and Google.Indian digital payments took off when the government pushed demonetization in 2016, invalidating most of the country’s high-value currency notes in a move to curb corruption and push Indians away from cash. The Unified Payments Interface or UPI has now surpassed a 100 million users three-and-a-half years after its launch, thanks to booming smartphone use and wireless data rates among the lowest in the world.Amazon and Google now vie with local startup Paytm, Walmart-PhonePe and a host of other players in a digital payments market forecast to quintuple to $1 trillion by 2023.“UPI has had the fastest acceptance rate not just among payment platforms but digital platforms of any kind,” said Dilip Asbe, chief executive officer of the National Payments Corporation of India, which groups the lenders that developed the system. “We aim to expand the UPI base to 500 million users in the next three years.”UPI sports an open architecture allowing digital wallet apps, payment banks and startups to link freely to its platform. That’s a contrast to the closed systems of China’s dominant services, WeChat and Alipay. It simplifies transactions between apps and banks linked through a biometric ID system called Aadhaar. Regulated by the central bank, it allows the instant transfer of funds between bank accounts through a mobile device using a simple virtual handle, without sharing bank or personal details. UPI’s creators now want to take the platform beyond the country’s borders and allow payments in places like Singapore or the Middle East with a dense population of Indian expatriates.Global tech companies are racking up enormous losses as they battle for a slice of a market forecast to grow to $1 trillion by 2023 from about $200 billion early this year, according to Credit Suisse. Between SoftBank-backed Paytm, Walmart’s PhonePe and Amazon Pay alone, collective losses totaled over $1 billion in the financial year ending March, a 167% spike from the previous year, according to the Economic Times. Losses are mounting as they drive further into India’s smaller cities and towns, luring merchants and first-time phone users with cashbacks and financial sweeteners.All those players aim to get into services like lending as their next move, so they can start making money, said Arnav Gupta, a New Delhi-based digital strategy analyst at Forrester Research. “The market potential in a country of nearly 1.4 billion Indians is massive.”But competition is set to worsen. Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp is seeking final approval for the full-fledged countrywide launch of its payments service, which has been in a long-drawn pilot phase with just 1 million users. Experts predict that the entry of WhatsApp into the arena will mark another inflection point because of an estimated user base of more than 400 million.WhatsApp Payments will be launched “soon” in India, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg told investors in a post-earnings conference call this week.

272,1-11-2019,Warren Buffett’s worst year since 2009 splits investors,"By Katherine ChiginskyBill Ackman piled in. David Rolfe exited.Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s rotation of investors over the past few months points to the question lingering over the conglomerate as it heads for its worst annual underperformance since 2009: Is it worth waiting for Warren Buffett to make a dent in his record $122 billion cash pile?Ackman’s stake in Berkshire, disclosed in August, is a bullish bet. His idea is simple: Growth at Berkshire’s underlying businesses and the company’s competitive position will boost earnings even if the funds aren’t deployed. Rolfe, whose firm had been a Berkshire investor for decades, grew tired of waiting.“He has missed this glorious bull market,” said Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners Inc. His company, which oversees $2.2 billion, trimmed its Berkshire stake in the second quarter and exited completely in the third. “The bullish thesis that this massive amount of cash is going to come to bear incredible fruit -- hasn’t.”Berkshire’s third-quarter results, set to be released Saturday, should give investors a sense of how Buffett is handling the “Niagara” of cash generation in a period with no major acquisitions to ramp up growth. Berkshire stock climbed 4.2% through the end of October, short of the 21% price gain in the S&P 500.Bloomberg Part of that underperformance stems from disappointment that Berkshire’s mountain of cash sits idle, UBS Group AG analysts led by Brian Meredith said in an October note. Buffett has sought out major acquisitions but has failed to strike a large deal in recent years amid what he called “sky-high” valuations.“If you look at sort of all the ingredients in that stock, it’s a stock without a catalyst,” Cathy Seifert, an analyst with CFRA Research, said in an interview.Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has turned to share buybacks to deploy some cash, repurchasing $2.1 billion this year through the end of June. That’s a “modest” amount, according to UBS analysts. JPMorgan Chase & Co., which counts Berkshire among its largest investors, repurchased more than $6 billion on a net basis in the third quarter alone.Buffett was able to put some of his cash to work earlier this year. He agreed in April to invest $10 billion for preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corp., which was pursuing Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Berkshire didn’t respond to a request for comment.Some credit Buffett’s patience for his ability to secure well-priced deals that have taken his company from a struggling textile mill to a conglomerate worth more than $500 billion. As the S&P 500 keeps setting records, sitting on the M&A sidelines might be the right move because of high valuations, according to analyst Meyer Shields.“That’s when everyone else is being greedy, in which case you should be fearful and that’s very consistent with their philosophy,” Shields, of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in an interview. “It does translate into doing nothing. But maybe nothing is the right approach or the best of all the bad alternatives.”Rolfe said the biggest driver for Berkshire’s growth will be the billionaire investor’s ability to reinvest the funds at Berkshire, which enjoys what Buffett has called a “Niagara of cash-generation.” The record funds on the balance sheet and the cash coming from its multitude of insurance companies, retailers and energy businesses every quarter make that task challenging, he said.“He has a gigantic task ahead of him,” Rolfe said. “If he is successful doing that, really successful, then Bill Ackman will be right and I’ll be wrong.”For now, Rolfe took the roughly $200 million that was invested in Berkshire and redeployed the vast majority into the stock of a company Buffett once said he regretted not betting on: Alphabet Inc.Here are some other topics that might come up Saturday:Kraft HeinzBerkshire’s bet on the packaged-food giant has stumbled in recent quarters as Kraft Heinz Co. grappled with writedowns, a management shakeup and investigations. Buffett, who teamed up with 3G Capital to help orchestrate the merger of Kraft and Heinz, has admitted that they overpaid for Kraft and said in February that he had no plans to sell or buy more of the company’s stock.Kraft Heinz shares surged 13% Thursday after the company reported strong earnings driven by higher prices for products such as macaroni and cheese. While sales beat estimates, they still declined from a year earlier, highlighting the challenge ahead for CEO Miguel Patricio.Thursday’s gain narrowed Kraft Heinz’s loss this year to 25%, helping ease the pressure on the value of Berkshire’s stake. Still, the holding value has fallen below how it’s marked on Berkshire’s books. That could mean that Buffett’s company will take an eventual writedown, according to CFRA’s Seifert.“The Kraft Heinz deal is a big black mark on the track record of Berkshire’s acquisitions,” she said in an interview.Share BuybacksBerkshire loosened its repurchase strategy last year, then bought back $928 million of stock during the third quarter of 2018. It has spent a total of $3.4 billion on repurchases since the policy tweak.KBW’s Shields says he expects Berkshire to report about $536 million in share buybacks. UBS analysts are assuming that Berkshire repurchased around $900 million of its stock in the quarter. Both estimates would outpace its repurchases in the second quarter.“I don’t think it’s evolved enough,” Seifert said of Berkshire’s buyback policy. “I think it was, in some respects, a way to placate shareholders.”InsuranceInsurers including Travelers Cos. are warning about challenging legal issues. Travelers CEO Alan Schnitzer has said he’s seen a “more aggressive” level of attorney involvement on some claims. That could factor into Berkshire’s insurance results, according to KBW’s Shields.“Companies are acknowledging that the environment for litigation has gotten more difficult,” Shields said.Shields also said that rate cuts at auto insurer Geico could weigh on margins, even if it sees faster policy growth.And natural catastrophes hit during the quarter, including Typhoon Faxai and Hurricane Dorian. The typhoon, which pummeled Japan in September, caused as much as $7 billion in insured losses, according to risk modeler AIR Worldwide. Dorian tore through the Bahamas in the third quarter, leaving behind as much as $3 billion in estimated insured losses.Rail RecessionU.S. railroads have been dealing with the fallout from trade disputes, leading to concerns about a “rail recession.” BNSF’s rival in the Western U.S., Union Pacific Corp., reported third-quarter profit that missed analyst estimates and the steepest drop in carloads in three years.UBS analysts said in a note that BNSF’s volumes probably declined in the third quarter, but the railroad might benefit from a boost in revenue per car.“They have one of the top franchises in the industry, but there’s some cyclical pressures there,” Seifert said.Market SwingsGyrations in Berkshire’s $200 billion stock portfolio now factor into net income, an accounting change that Buffett says investors should look past. Barclays Plc said the investment gains could total $7 billion before taxes.Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","Hello! I'm an AI assistant that follows instructions extremely well.

276,1-11-2019,"US urges countries to buy arms from America, not from Russia, China","WASHINGTON: A Trump administration official has urged countries not to buy military hardware from Russia and China, asserting that America's competitors were using arms sales as key tools to build their own influence around the world. Although the official did not name any country, Washington has in the past cautioned India that its decision to buy the long-range S-400 Triumf missile defence system from Russia will have serious implications on defence ties. India and Russia signed a USD 5 billion S-400 air defence system deal in October last after wide-ranging talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a major policy speech, Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Clarke Cooper on Thursday said that a partnership with America offers something a purchase from Russia or China never will: friendship. ""Our competitors are turning to arms sales and security assistance as key tools to build their own influence around the world, and to weaken ours,"" he said. In his speech on 'America As The Partner of Choice' at Meridian International Center, the top American diplomat illustrated with multiple, specific examples that those who seek to purchase Russian and Chinese military equipment should consider carefully and follow the rule of Caveat emptor -- a principle that the buyer alone is responsible for checking the quality and suitability of goods before a purchase is made. In contrast, the United States offers quality, transparency and accountability, and a long term, secure, and sincere partnership in support of shared security interests and common values, he said. Cooper identified China and Russia as strategic competitors whose efforts have been to proliferate arms around the world. ""We have come a long way since the AK-47 became the ubiquitous symbol of Soviet-backed insurgencies from Southeast Asia to Africa. Today, Russia is working hard to foist variants of its S-400 air defence system around the world, while China is supplying everything from armoured personnel carriers to armed drones. ""To quote another Latin phrase - caveat emptor! - Buyer, beware. We have seen countries around the world leap at the chance to obtain high-tech, low cost defensive capabilities only to see their significant investments crumble and rust in their hands,"" Cooper said. ""It is true that the United States remains far and away the greatest provider both of direct security through the deterrence of our alliances and the presence of our global forces, true we remain the single greatest provider of grant security assistance, to the tune of over USD 10 billion a year between State and Defence, and, true we remain far and away the most significant source of defensive equipment for countries around the world,"" he said. Cooper alleged that through the targeted marketing of systems like the S-400, Russia seeks to exploit the genuine security requirements of partners to create challenges in US' ability - legal and technological - to provide them with the most advanced defensive capabilities. And through a combination of cut-price systems such as unmanned aerial systems, predatory financing mechanisms and sometimes outright bribery, China is using arms transfers as a means of getting its foot in the door - a door that, once opened, China quickly exploits both to exert influence and to gather intelligence, he said. ""It is true, if we scratch the surface of the offers laid out by our adversaries we find failed systems, flawed training, false bargains. And it is important countries around the world understand the risks of choosing to procure systems from China or from Russia. ""But while it is important that we lift the veil on our strategic competitors, it is more important that we make the case for why partnering with America is not just the better choice, but indeed the best choice,"" Cooper said. It is the quality of US defence equipment. It is American commitment not just to make deals, but to build capabilities, he said. ""It is the transparency, accountability, and predictability of our policies and processes. And it is the reassurance that comes from partnering with the United States military,"" Cooper asserted. The United States is the preeminent global security partner in both the capabilities it provides, and the reassurance that comes with its friendship. US defence equipment remains far-and-away the most capable in every warfighting domain, from the F-35 to the Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD), from its electronic warfare suites to early warning radars, from the Apache in the air to the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle on the ground to the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant in the oceans, he added. The S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system. China was the first foreign buyer to seal a government-to-government deal with Russia in 2014 to procure the lethal missile system."," The article reports on an official from the US who urged countries not to purchase military hardware from Russia and China, asserting that America's competitors were using arms sales as key tools to build their own influence around the world.

278,1-11-2019,Income tax department cancels registration of six Tata Trusts,"MUMBAI: The income-tax department has cancelled the registration of six Tata Trusts — Jamsetji Tata Trust, RD Tata Trust, Tata Education Trust, Tata Social Welfare Trust, Sarvajanik Seva Trust and Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust. The order was issued by the office of the principal commissioner of income tax, Mumbai, on October 31.“The Trusts would like to clarify that this order of cancellation is a culmination of the decision taken by these six Trusts in 2015 to surrender, of their own volition, their registration under the Income Tax Act and to not claim the associated tax exemptions. The decision to surrender the registration (an option available in law) was taken in the best interests of the Trusts and to maximise the resources available to the Trusts for their charitable work which is the principal object and focus of the Trusts,” Tata Trusts said in a statement late on Friday.Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill CoursesOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Digital OfficerVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Chief Technology OfficerVisitIIM LucknowIIML Chief Marketing Officer ProgrammeVisitThe statement reiterated the stand of the Tata Trusts that the cancellation should take effect from 2015. “While the tax department’s order has cancelled the Trusts’ registration with immediate effect, we believe that as a matter of law and consistent with the department’s own decision in the past, the cancellation should take effect from 2015, when the registrations were surrendered and the Trusts themselves consented to cancellation.”Tata Trusts said they are studying the order and will take legal recourse soon.“The Trusts are examining the order and will take necessary next steps in accordance with the law. The Trusts have effective legal options to vindicate their grievances against the order both factually and legally,” said the statement from Tata Trusts.According to sources familiar with the issue, the tax authorities have ‘refused’ to accept the Trusts’ contention that the cancellation should be with effect from 2015. Sources said the I-T department will soon send a demand notice.“There is no merit in the Trusts’ contention that since they have surrendered their licence in 2015, provisions of Section 115 (TD) cannot be applied. The cancellation order has been passed, and it will be followed by a demand notice that amounts to several thousand crores,” said a person privy to the development.According to Section 115 (TD) of the I-T Act, a trust whose registration is cancelled must pay tax on accumulated income.In July, the tax department had served notices on the six Tata trusts seeking to reopen assessment and questioning their decision to ‘surrender’ registrations in 2015.Replying to the notice last month, the Trusts said they had already surrendered their registration provisions under I-T Act, and that the levy of additional tax — which accrues if a charitable trust converts into or merges with a non-charitable trust or transfers its assets on dissolution to a non-charitable institution — cannot be applied to them, sources told ET.In the statement, the Trusts said they hadn’t received a demand notice. “We would also like to clarify that Trusts have not received any demand notice from the Income Tax Department pursuant to the cancellation order, as has been speculated in certain sections of the media. It is equally surprising how the issue of seizure of the Trusts’ assets has been raised today.”The dispute dates back to 2013, when the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) pointed out that Jamsetji Tata Trust and Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust had invested Rs 3,139 crore in “prohibited modes of investment”. The CAG had noted that the I-T department had given “irregular tax exemptions” to these trusts, resulting in Rs 1,066 crore escaping tax.In March 2015, the Tata Trusts moved the tax department to surrender registrations (under Section 12AA of the I-T Act) while admitting that some of their assets were not in compliance with the provisions of Section 13(1)(d) of the Act. However, following the CAG’s observations and subsequent remarks by a subpanel of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament in 2018, the matter was transferred from the division looking into tax exemptions to the I-T department’s assessment wing, that has now sought an explanation from the Trusts.The Trusts, according to the PAC report, were investing in prohibited modes of investment despite the law forbidding public charitable trusts from holding such assets after 1973."," The six Tata Trusts have had their registration cancelled by the office of the principal commissioner of income tax, Mumbai, on October 31. The cancellation order was issued due to the Trusts' decision in 2015 to surrender their registration under the Income Tax Act and not claim the associated tax exemptions. The statement from Tata Trusts reiterates that the cancellation should take effect from 2015, as per the law, and they will soon file legal recourse against the order."

282,1-11-2019,Turkish import seeds a poppy war in India,"Poppy war, or perhaps poppy skirmish. India’s heavily regulated poppy economy – the milky white fluid from seeds, called latex, is the mainstay of illegal drugs trade around the world – is witnessing a small but intense conflict over the Central Board of Narcotics (CBN) decision to ship in 18,000 metric tonnes of white poppy seeds from Turkey.A group of poppy importers and India’s poppy farmers are alleging that a small number of importers have cornered the latest import order via an informal cartel. The allegation is also that these importers had paid Turkish exporters much in advance of the CBN order.Questions sent to CBN by ET around two weeks back were not answered at the time of going to press. ET is not naming importers alleged to have acted as a cartel because it could not independently verify these charges. Some importers making these allegations spoke off record.While a section of the importers cry foul over the alleged role of a cartel “cornering” import permits, the farmers are worried about an impending stock glut and depressed poppy prices next year. According to a group of importers whom ET consulted, three large ‘impex’ (import-export) companies based out of Bengaluru, New Delhi and Pune – along with 70-odd group companies – have managed to corner a large number of import permits issued by CBN in the last week of September. This cartel is alleged to have made advance payment to Turkish poppy exporters (to procure poppy seeds), several days prior to the CBN’s import notification. “It is clear the cartel knew about the notification well in advance…,” said a Mumbai-based importer.“The cartel members have effectively blocked a lion’s share of poppy seeds that can be imported to India this year. We were shown a ‘no-stock board’ when we approached some Turkish exporters. They told us the country-limits have been exhausted,” he said.Poppy cultivation, much like poppy seed imports, is heavily restricted in India. The CBN gives licences to a few farmers (about 25,000 to 30,000 farmers) every year to grow the crop. The seeding season begins in October; by February, farmers begin to collect latex by making a small incision on the plant’s stem. The latex collected thus, is transported to opium factories at Ghazipur and Neemuch to derive alkaloids such as morphine, papaverine, codeine and noscapine – all used in modern medicine. Poppy seeds are also used for cooking.Last cropping season, farmers managed to get Rs 70,000 – 1,00,000 per quintal selling the seeds. In poppy farming, farmers rarely make money selling the latex exclusively to the government. They may, at best, get Rs 2,000 – 2500 per kilogram. If they manage to smuggle a few packets to external buyers – an act which is illegal and a punishable offence – they may pocket upto `25 lakh per kilogram. But that is unbelievably impossible as latex collection is conducted under strict CBN supervision.There are restrictions (or entry barriers) on import of white poppy seeds to India. These can be shipped in only on permits issued by the Gwalior-based CBN. After CBN put out the notification, Indian importers have to ask any legitimate Turkish exporter to register a sales contract with the Turkish Grain Board (or TMO). Once the sales contract is ready, the Indian importer approaches the CBN for a provisional registration – a copy of which will be sent to the TMO as well. The importer is then required to make an advance payment (20% of consignment cost) favouring the Turkish exporter. This effectively “blocks” the quantity that can be imported by the importer from Turkey.“The cartel has made the payments well in advance (even before the date of CBN import notification), and has blocked several batches of consignments that can be imported,” alleged an importer from Jaipur.“We approached the courts for a remedy; and the Gujarat High Court asked CBN to appear for a deposition in the first week of October; but the CBN hurriedly issued permits to cartel members prior to them appearing in court,” the importer added. CBN officials were not available for comments. An email sent to CBN’s offices at Gwalior, Neemuch and Lucknow elicited no response till press time.WHY IMPORT?The government could be importing seeds to satisfy WTO statute – which brackets poppy as a ‘freeto-import’ commodity. “The government has put in place restrictions / entry barriers to prevent free import of poppy and other narcotic substances into India,” says NN Menon of Trade Track, a foreign trade consultant. “The government could be under some WTO compulsion to allow free import of poppy seeds into India. But farmers could be at the receiving end of this policy decision,” he adds.RS Chundawat, an opium cultivation specialist at Horticulture College in Mandsaur, is baffled at the government’s decision to import poppy seeds this year. According to him, poppy yields have been robust over the past few years – with 11 – 14 quintal per hectare every year.“The latex belongs to the government and the residual seeds belong to farmers. Farmers make good sums of money selling the seeds in open market,” Chundawat said.“Seed yield was very good this year, and we got good price for it. If the government is importing seeds this year, seed prices may crash next year,” said Sheetalsingh Solanki, a poppy farmer from Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh."," The article discusses a conflict between importers and farmers in India over the decision of the Central Board of Narcotics (CBN) to ship in 18,000 metric tonnes of white poppy seeds from Turkey.

Many people always felt there could be mechanisms spying on us, but most people never really cared. Well, not deeply enough anyway. They say that only those who value their security, deserve it.

However, they state that their technology is “not permitted” to be used to violate human rights. Whats-App has taken NSO to court and the proceedings are awaited.WhatsApp has asserted that this cyberattack violated laws in the US, and also that it went against the Facebook-owned messaging service’s terms of service, which strictly forbid such exploitation. WhatsApp’s usage of end-to-end encryption means messages communicated via its infrastructure are expected to be secure. The quandary comes in when malicious code compromises the user’s device itself, in this case, the mobile phone.You Might Also Like:After Pegasus spying row, India asks WhatsApp to explain privacy breachDid someone, somewhere, consciously used a tool, meant only for State-use, against private citizens?

But WhatsApp’s convenience might keep most users still around.WhatsApp says they have patched this vulnerability in their stack, and all that consumers now need to do is ensure they are on the latest version of the application. They also need to keep their device’s operating system (OS) up to date.Facebook, WhatsApp’s parent company, is in a precarious position.

But there are many other applications that have the potential to be used against us without us realising it.Which is why we need to look at security and privacy from a macro perspective. The signal needs to be sent across to enterprises, developers and publishers all over. It doesn’t matter which political party rules our country today. Governments, by their very nature, want control, and to control. Future wars will be the ones driven by technology within a country’s borders.

Plenty, it appears, as a bunch of luxury hotels and high-end restaurants show the way.From inhouse organic gardens, strict farm-to-fork policies and consumer awareness and education initiatives to menus built around local, seasonal produce and reducing food loss and wastage, some leading eateries have stepped up their commitment to sustainability, in the process changing the way well-heeled urban Indians dine out.The Taj Safaris of the Indian Hotels Company Ltd. – located in or close to wildlife parks – work to keep their carbon footprint low by purchasing all produce locally and, as much as possible, within a 50 km radius of their lodges. The Taj Safaris grow vegetables using only natural manure and emphasis is given to locally grown and procured ingredients. Daily menus are curated depending on the fresh availability of produce and there is a stress on seasonal variety to ensure that the nutritional value of the food is intact.“Sustainability is a prerequisite for our operations. We encourage awareness among guests about the source of the food they are consuming. Our sustainable culinary initiatives are driven inhouse, in collaboration with local communities, which allows us to give back to society by enabling their livelihood,” said Nagendra Hada, area director at Taj Safaris.At restaurants of ITC Hotels, a simple traffic light-style indicator system encourages diners to make a sustainable choice while ordering. All domestic endangered species are off the menu and the chefs are encouraged to include sustainable alternatives of marine produce.The initiative is a co-creation of ITC Hotels, WWF India and the Central Marine Fisheries Institute and aims to enable better choices on fish purchases and ultimately protect global fish stocks from over-exploitation.More than 40% of the edibles at ITC Hotels are sourced locally, positively impacting social (employment for local producers) and environmental (minimising carbon footprint) parameters. The challenge of curbing food waste is being addressed by serving smaller portions. There are ongoing efforts to expand the network of local producers and farmers, said ITC.Experts said patrons today are consciously selecting sustainable options, with a positive impact on the environment and communities around. This includes endorsing luxury brands that have a planetpositive approach to business.PLAYING THEIR PARTAccording to Alice Helme, director at CAARA, which operates three restaurants in New Delhi, the most important thing about sustainable dining and sustainable food is conscience sourcing – knowing where the raw product comes from.“Customers feel more at ease that we have made that choice of sustainable eating for them. Our website promotes our farm and we talk about food origins through the menus and informed staff, who we train about our ethos,” Helme said. “Communicating to the patrons what we stand for is the most effective way of conveying the importance of sustainable, conscientious eating choices.”Fabcafe by Fabindia has tied up with Organic India to get ingredients. It makes a conscious decision to buy seasonal, regional and local produce, said chef Sunil Chauhan.“It’s more about education and also what goes into our menu. Seasonal ingredients… and menu balancing is the main part of our job,” said Jatin Mallick, chef at contemporary European restaurant, Tres, in the national capital.“It’s our moral responsibility to upgrade the menu to the season. There’s no point using ingredients like cauliflower, which isn’t available at a certain time of year, and put pressure on the environment and resources,” he said.At the Go Native chain of restaurants in Bengaluru, menus are changed every quarter, depending on what’s in season. The food is organic and the ingredients bought from farms in and around Karnataka. The chain even promotes lifestyle changes by offering customers organic products and apparel in their retail space.Bengaluru-based branding professional Argha Sarkar is a regular at restaurants offering such fare and finds that they are a refreshing change from the usual run-of-themill options.“The food’s fresher, it tastes and even looks better,” he said. Shopping artisanal and eating healthy are the two principles of restaurant AnnaMaya, located at the Andaz Delhi hotel. It has a retail food hall, which sells and uses the same ingredients that are responsibly sourced. Made in India is an important theme here and teams go through storytelling sessions to educate patrons about the betterment of the local community with the produce they use.“More customers want a socially conscious story to back up what they’re consuming. Chefs can’t really get away by serving just about anything anymore,” said Andaz Delhi’s executive chef Vikram Ganpule.Fine-dining, ingredient-driven Masque restaurant in Mumbai initially faced a backlash from customers who didn’t come back because they didn’t want to be told what to eat. “We cannot have, in a menu, 200 dishes a year – that is just not sustainable.A menu should be driven by what is in season,” said Prateek Sadhu, co-owner of Masque. Masque doesn’t have a menu – that’s where the education of customers starts. The daily offerings are driven by what the restaurant is allowed to use in a month.“I can’t have pumpkin or cabbage the entire month – the farmer doesn’t grow it that much,” Sadhu said. “We are a 70% agricultural nation but we are still dependent on imported vegetables. We need to educate our clients about these. If you really want to run a sustainable restaurant, you must have only 10-15 dishes on the menu.” Customer attitudes are changing now.“We have been vehement about what people should eat,” said Sadhu. “We must have lost a lot of customers – but we have gained double the amount of people we lost.”"," Great summary! Here's some additional information to help you understand how restaurants can save the planet:
- Reduce food waste by using all parts of the food and not throwing away scraps. This helps reduce the carbon footprint of the restaurant and protects local ecosystems by reducing the need for meat or grain waste.
- Use locally sourced ingredients, especially in areas where the demand is high. Supporting local farmers and producers can help reduce the environmental impact of transportation and increase the nutritional value of the food.
- Educate customers about sustainable eating choices through menus, informed staff, and social media campaigns. This helps promote conscious consumption and encourages customers to choose more sustainable options.
- Invest in renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power to reduce the carbon footprint of the restaurant's operations. Additionally, using public transportation or carpooling can help reduce the environmental impact of transportation."
